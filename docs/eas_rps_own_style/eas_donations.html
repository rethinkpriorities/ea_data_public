<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Introduction and summary</h2>
<p>Very brief: Statement about the importance of charitable giving and the data collection here. (cut …), what we present, …
linked outline here, e.g.,</p>
<p>…</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="eas_donations.html#total_mag">total magnitude of EA giving</a> and its relationship
to non-EA giving, …</li>
<li><a href="eas_donations.html#plan-actual">EA’s donation plans versus realized donations</a> (and
<a href="eas_donations.html#next-year">future plans</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Our <a href="eas_donations.html#modeling">modeling work</a> work considers how donations (total,
share-of-income, and ‘donated over 1000 USD’) jointly relates to a range
of characteristics. We present:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="eas_donations.html#descriptive">‘descriptive’ results</a>: focusing on
<a href="eas_donations.html#demog_mod">demographics</a>, <a href="eas_donations.html#mod_emp">employment and careers</a>, and
the ‘continuous features’ age, time-in-EA, income, and year of
survey.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="eas_donations.html#predictive-models">‘Predictive’ models</a>, allowing the ‘machine learning’
models themselves to choose which features seem to be most important
for predicting donations.</p></li>

<li><p>The median percentage of income donated in 2019 was
2.14% (cf 2.61% in
2018).</p></li>
<li><p>However, if we impute “0 and missing incomes” at “group medians for student-status and country,”<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> the median percentage of income donated was 2% for 2019.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Mean</em> share of <em>total</em> (imputed) income donated was
9.4% (imputing income where below 5k
or missing) or 12.5% without imputation.</p></li>
</ul>
<!-- DR: note, I checked there indeed are 3 'median' obs donating exactly 3 percent of income in 2019 -->
<ul>
<li><p>19.9% of EAs who answered the donation
question reported donating 10% or more of their income in
2019 (if we impute income; otherwise
21.4% without imputation; this compares to
…, without imputation).</p></li>
<li><p>The median percent of income donated by full-time-employed
non-students who earned more than $10,000 was
2.92%, and of this group
23.9% donated 10% of their income or
more in 2018 (cf 3.38% and 24% in 2018).</p></li>
<li><p>Overall, those taking the EA survey tend to report donating a
substantially greater share of income than <a href="eas_donations.html#usa-don">those in the general US
population</a> – (<a href="https://rethinkpriorities.github.io/ea_data_public/eas_donations.html#usa-don">web

donation question, only 20.9% answered at
least one question about <em>where</em> they donated.</li>
</ul>
<!-- Todo: can we get a better default presentation of numbers and in line code so that I don't have to use this "op()" function all the time? -->
<ul>
<li>Among these, the charity that the most EAs stated that they donated
to was (…) <!-- the Against Malaria Foundation (AMF)--> with
121 reported donations (out of a total of
715 reported donations).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p>Global Poverty charities continue to attract (…) the largest
counts and amounts of donations. 62% of
those who answered the relevant question reported donating to this
category. 55.1% of the total ‘where
donated’ reports were to global poverty charities. We sum
1,703,870 USD in total donations reported as specifically
going to global poverty charities.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<!-- TODO cut or soft-code and condense For the small share
    that *can* be tracked across years, donations tend to exceed plans
    (by around 60 USD at median, but over 1000 USD at mean). However,
    the *overall distribution* of donations for a particular year
    (including all respondents) tends to fall short of the distribution
    of planned donations (by about 450 USD at median and over 2000 at
    mean).

-   While at median [EAs tend to report](#next-year) planning to donate
    the same amount this *next year* that they donate in each particular
    year, the average (mean) plan for next year is ... significantly
    larger.

"We were requested to change the question between 2018/2019 and 2020... but looking at non-students (who are largely already in their careers), the responses across years may still be comparable and appear to show a slight decline in E2G"

In the tables and graphs below, the apparent steep drop in the number indicating ETG from the 2019 to the 2020 survey seems likely to be overstated (as a result of a requested change in the question language and options provided).^[*Question texts*

2018: "What broad career path are you planning to follow?" [4 options]

2019: "If you had to guess, which broad career path(s) are you planning to follow?" [9 options]

2020: "Which of the following best describes your current career?" [11 options]

Note that the changing composition of EA survey respondents may also affect this.

<!-- Still, the responses for *non-students* might be less sensitive to the changes in the survey question as they are more likely to be *in* a career path as their 'current career'. These responses also suggest some decline in EtG. -->

<p>We compare the results for 2020 (for 2019 donations):</p>
<ul>
<li>Median donation (of those reporting): 528 USD</li>
<li>Donation of $1000 puts you in the
59.5th percentile.</li>
<li>Being in the top 10% requires donating 9,972</li>
<li>Being in the top 1% means donating
89,560 USD.</li>
</ul>
<p>… <!-- comments (or leave out) --></p>
<!-- As in previous years, the mean far exceeds the median, (and falls close to the 90th percentile!); a very small number of very large donations dwarf the size of most others. We illustrate this in the 'treemap' plot below, which divides the total reported contributions into groups by size-of-contribution. -->

<!-- ... softcode description, or skip. It's pretty obvious Those reporting 'for profit-earning to give' career paths represent the largest share, nearly half of the total donations, despite making up  only about 15% of the sample (of those answering this question). Those with 'for profit' careers who do not say they are earning to give donate about 15% of the total, roughly in proportion to their 12% share of the sample. However all of these differences may reflect differences in income and wealth levels, as well as differences in underlying characteristics of people who choose different career paths.

Direct work does not seem to be obviously coming at the expense of donations. Those pursuing careers working at EA-affiliated non-profits account for a somewhat higher share of donations (12%) than their (8%) share of the sample. (However, we do not know how much these particular EAs *would* have given had they chosen a different career.)

--></p>
<p>We put this in perspective, considering that income levels are different
between these career paths:</p>

<p>The plot above depicts mean income and mean donations by ‘career group,’
with 95% CI’s for the latter. We superimpose a ‘line of best fit’ (blue,
with smoothed 95% intervals for this rough fit) and a ‘10% of income
donation’ line (red). Unsurprisingly, for-profit ‘not-EtG’ are below the
fitted line, and ‘for-profit EtG’ above this line, although 95% CIs are
fairly wide. We also note that among people in non-profit careers, there
are similar average incomes whether or not the non-profit is EA-aligned,
but the non-profit <em>EA</em> people seem to donate somewhat more (although
the CI’s do overlap).</p>

<p>Compare the above graph to the ‘donations by donations size’ graph…</p>
<!-- ... or cut The largest *earners* (the
7 people
earning 1 million USD or more) represent 35% of the donations (cf the
largest *donors* represent 36% of the donations). However, the
second-highest earners, the
8
people earning between 500k and 1 million USD represent only 6% of the
donations (cf 20% from the second-highest *donation* group). In fact,
the second largest share of total 2020 donations come from the
second-largest (in *population*) income-group in our sample, the
406
people earning between 50K and 100K USD.

<!--- In 2019, the largest summed donation amount came from

-   the UK (about 11% of the sample but 41% of the donations)

-   and the USA (30% of the sample and 37% of the donations).

Across all years: ...

-   the USA represents the largest amount of donations,

-   with the UK a close second,

<p>Summarize or skip discussion of this here….</p>
<!--
Again, the UK 'punches far above its weight.'  Note that the UK share may be *understated*, if UK donors claim the matching 'Gift Aid' but do not report it as part of their donation.^[In the UK the government's ['Gift Aid' policy](https://www.gov.uk/donating-to-charity/gift-aid) supplements all reported donations made by UK taxpayers by an additional 25%.
]


Again, these raw difference may reflect differences in income and life circumstances among survey respondents from different countries. The outsized UK share also seems to be driven by a few large outlying donations -- when we Winsorise donations at 100K USD, the UK no longer overperforms.

<p>The histograms beloware first only for those with positive reported incomes, and next with the previously-discussed income imputation. The blue vertical line depicts the share of <em>total</em> (imputed) income donated by all
respondents, with the green line depicting the median and the red line
the 90th percentile. …</p>

<p>The noticeable spike at 10% likely reflects the GWWC pledge (we return
to this further below). As noted above,
19.9% of EAs reported a donation at or
above 10% of their (imputed) income in 2019.
36.1% reported an amount at or above 5%.</p>
<!-- TODOS:
- overlay (smoothed) histograms (low)
- compare/overlay prior years (medium to low, but would be very cool)
-- animate year to year (medium to low, but would be very cool)

<p><strong>How do donations relate to income, and does this relationship differ
between those who mention that they took the Giving What We Can (10%)
pledge?</strong></p>
<!-- We first simply plot reported donations against income, simply dividing
individuals (points) by whether they mention having taken the GWWC
pledge. -->
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb38"><pre class="sourceCode r collapse"><div><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb38-1"><a href="eas_donations.html#cb38-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>don_income_gwwc_sp</span></code></div></pre></div>
<p><img src="ea_survey_work_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>We give a scatterplot of reported donations against income, faceted by
GWWC pledge, with separate locally-smoothed conditional means (and 95%
confidence intervals for these conditional means). (The figure below is
for 2019 donations only.)</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb39"><pre class="sourceCode r collapse"><div><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb39-1"><a href="eas_donations.html#cb39-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>don_income_gwwc_sp_gwwc</span></code></div></pre></div>
<p><img src="ea_survey_work_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>…</p>
<!--
Unsurprisingly, those with higher incomes, and those who took the GWWC
pledge tend to report donating more. On average, the GWWC pledgers
report giving more throughout the whole range of income, and the 95%
confidence intervals are distinct for most of the range.\*
-->
<!-- ...? \^[This
agrees with what we reported in 2019:

"In the EA Survey 2019 data, the median percentage of income donated by
someone who had taken the GWWC Pledge was 8.87%, short of the 10%
target, though there could be some noise around how respondents reported
income and donations. Nevertheless, this of course could be influenced
by GWWC Pledge takers being students, not employed or only recently
having taken the Pledge. We addressed this question in more depth last
year (link): GWWC members donate more than non-GWWC members, both
absolutely and as a percentage of income but \~40% of self-reported GWWC
members were not reporting donation data that is consistent with keeping
their pledge, a trend most likely to be the result of attrition over
time."^[Note that the smaller group who did not respond to the GWWC pledge prompt but *did* provide a donation response seems to resemble the non-pledgers. We thus lump these groups together in the subsequent analysis.]
-->
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Next we plot donations as <em>shares of income</em> against income for non-GWWC
pledgers (combined with non-responders) and GWWC pledgers. The median
for each group is given by the dashed blue line, and the dashed red line
represents 10 percent of income.</p>

<!--
The relationship between income and 'share of income donated' dips down
for the lowest incomes, but for the mass of 'substantial donors' the
curve is fairly flat, and then seems to increase at higher incomes. As
expected, GWWC pledgers tend to donate closer to 10% of income than do
the rest.

In each year substantially larger shares of those who report having made
a GWWC pledge report donating 10% or more. Below, we tabulate this by
donation year and by 'whether they report having ever made a GWWC
pledge, for individuals who report income over 5000 USD and who report
zero or positive donations:

donations, and excluding those reporting incomes below 5000 USD) [… share who report donating over 10%, discussion and caveats]</p>
<!-- less
than half report donating 10% in the past year. However, this may be an
underestimate, as some people are reporting having pledged for
*this/next* year, while donation reports are for the previous
year.^[Furthermore, this does not tell us that people are failing to meet an active pledge. The question asks about having *ever* taken the GWWC pledge'; some of these people might have *ended* their pledge at some point.

As a share of income, we again see donations positively associated with time in EA, at least for the older age groups.^[This also holds when we look within groups of 'referrers' (which link took a respondent to the survey.) We report a graph on this [in the online appendix as a robustness check](#don_share_by_tenure_facet_referrer) ([web link](https://rethinkpriorities.github.io/ea_data_public/eas_donations.html#don_share_by_tenure_facet_referrer)).

TODO: Move this discussion to the methods book and link it.

the EAS may also not be representative of the EA population cross-sectionally, i.e., it may over or under-represent certain demographic or interest-oriented subpopulations. Still, if this unrepresentativeness is 'constant from year to year', the total reported donations in each year will at least provide a reliable measure of how the donations of this (somewhat nonrepresentative) weighted average is changing from year to year. Note that the issue of cross-sectional representativeness (and changes in this) is equally relevant to questions of 'average donations' as it is to questions of 'total donations'.

(Further discussion of this can be found in the
[Bookdown](https://rethinkpriorities.github.io/ea_data_public/eas-donations.html#donation-and-income-trends-in-ea)
at this point).


::: {.foldable}

1.  If the EAS response rates (and the response rates to the donation question in particular) vary year-to-year in proportion to the total size of the EA population representative, we may want to simply focus on the totals, which should move in proportion to the *true* totals.\*

2.  On the other hand, suppose the number of responses to the EAS fluctuates from year to year *not* in proportion to the size of EA, but its composition *is* representative of the EA movement as a whole. In this case it may be more reliable to report mean or median donations of EAS respondents, and combine this with extrapolations and 'guesstimates' based on separate estimates of changes in the size of EA (themselves in informed by data including the EA survey).

3.  To the extent that the EAS response total is both fluctuating (independently of the size of EA) and nonrepresentative, we may be only able make statements about changes in donations among particular subgroups, and even then the within-subgroup composition may change.

<p>We next consider a similar report with donation-nonresponses coded as 0.</p>

<p><em>Discussion/details:</em></p>
<div class="foldable"><a>Show</a><div class="collapse">
<p>The above only considers people who <em>did</em> answer donation questions. At
an extreme we could consider all non-responses as reflecting people who
made (little or) no donations, for a lower bound on on donation rates.
As a compromise measure, probably a tighter lower bound, we might assume
that people willing to report their incomes are generally willing to
answer financial questions. Thus if they do not report their donations
it seems <em>more</em> reasonable to suspect that they did not donate in a big
way. We thus consider the subset of the above who reported their income,
considering similar statistics as above for a modified donation
variable, coded as ‘0’ where the donation was not reported.</p>

While the linear plots and tests of donation amounts suggest no substantial or significant differences in overall donations between these years, the log specification does suggest some year-to-year differences, with (log) 2019 donations being significantly lower than 2017 donations, even after accounting for multiple comparisons. We return to this, to some extent, in our descriptive modeling.^[While this may merit further investigation, the differences in response composition across years make statistical inference challenging, and we thus do not make this our main focus. Cross-year differences could be inflated or masked by these changes.

@Oska: make a table, for those reporting at least 1 charity `filter(num_named_dons>0)`,

<p><!-- as much or more on average to each category (other than perhaps Long Term & AI), although none of these individual differences meet conventional statistical significance in simple F-tests (note that these tests are fairly low-powered due to small sample sizes). As the second table illustrates, GWWC pledgers are more likely to have *donated* to each of these categories, and *this* difference *is* statistically significant in standard chi-sq tests for all categories except 'Global Health and Development'. This can be seen seen in the $\chi^2$ tests in the "Donated to category" table, as well as in uncorrected Fisher's exact tests: $p=$ 0.105 for 'Global Health and Development', $p<0.01$ for all other categories. --></p>

<!-- Note: Actual vs Planned also provides a check on the data and the year-to-year trend, to see if it is driven response -->
<p>Do people meet or exceed the amount they intended or planned to donate for the next year?</p>
<!-- What factors relate to this? Our surveys provide some
evidence. -->
<p>In recent surveys, we have asked “In [current year] how much do you currently plan to donate?” We also ask “in [previous year], roughly how much money did you donate?”</p>
<p><em>Note: timings of surveys:</em></p>
<div class="foldable"><a>Show</a><div class="collapse">
<p>The EA surveys have been released at various points in the year:</p>
<p>In 2017, the survey was released in April; thus the ‘plan’ was reported only about 1/3 of the way through the year (or slightly later, depending on response time).</p>
<p>In 2018, the survey was released in May.</p>
<p>In 2019, it was released in August, about 3/4 of the way throughout the year.</p>
<p>Thus, for each of these years, the year-to-year comparison may tell us
something about whether people lived up to their plans.</p>

<!-- xxx? This could be
particularly relevant for the 2017 and 2018 surveys, but also relevant
for 2019-20, particularly if donations tend to be clustered at years'
end (e.g., Christmas giving, Giving Tuesday in November).\*

::: {.marginote}
\* This clustering seems to hold true for giving in the USA overall.
E.g., Charity Navigator (citing the 'Digital giving index') states that
[31% of annual giving occurred in the month of
December](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=360).

Below, we compare this 2019 report of planned-2019 donation to reports
from the 2020 EAS of *actual* 2019 donations. We report this for several
different groupings below, as well as for other pairings of surveys.

<!-- The above graphs do not suggest large differences in these
distributions.\^[However, 'visual inspection' risks reading patterns
into noise, and vice-versa; this speaks for formal statistical testing.
In future modeling we may also wish to consider whether this could also
reflect 'regression to the mean'; those who report planning an unusually
high (low) amount may tend to actually donate a more typical amount,
i.e., a lower (higher) amount.
-->
<p>We ran a series of simulation-based ‘permutation tests’ to consider
compare the medians and means of the <em>distributions</em> of planned and
actual donations for these linked individuals. Results are included in
the table “Actual minus planned donations for 2019, linked participants
(2019 - 2020)” in the section <a href="eas_donations.html#plan-actual-all">Planned vs. actual: All
respondents</a>. … <!-- These tests are inconclusive (not statistically significant, with wide confidence intervals),--></p>
<p><a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<!--
\*\* The overlap appears stronger for those who made a GWWC pledge. For the non-GWWC responses, we see:

-   for smaller donations (about 10-600 USD) 'actual donation' mass somewhat the exceeds 'planned donation' mass

-   for medium-large donations (about 600-5000 USD), the reverse, as 'planned donations' somewhat exceed 'actual donations', especially for non-GWWC people

-   for the largest donations, above about 8000 or so, the 'actual' again has a somewhat greater mass than planned

We do not present statistical tests on these small intervals, nor on the differences between GWWC and non-GWWC.

<h4>Donations versus plans (same individuals, linked)</h4>
<p>While the graphs and figures above help us understand whether the <em>distribution</em> of planned and actual gifts differ, it does not tell us whether any <em>individual’s</em> donation meets or exceeds his or her plan. As we are considering individuals present in <em>both</em> surveys, we can connect their donation responses across years.</p>
<p>The graph below shows the distribution over the <em>difference</em> in planned and actual 2019 donations for those matched across the years. Here a negative value corresponds to an actual donation being lower than planned.</p>

<p>Planned and actual donations are… highly correlated (<span class="math inline">\(\rho =\)</span>
0.948).</p>
<!-- While substantial shares report substantially less or more than their
plan, this more or less balances out, with some tendency towards
donating *more* than planned.-->
<p>… In fact, the mean difference between
donation and plan is 1,139 USD in excess of plan (the green
line), while the median of the differences is 67.9 USD.</p>
<p>Considering that the zeroes might have been quick and uncareful mis-responses, we repeat the same plot for those who report <em>positive</em> planned and actual donations in the consecutive years, and compare these for GWWC pledgers versus non-pledgers:</p>

<!-- The results are similar -- substantial shares outperformed their plans,
and substantial shares underperformed, but the positives seem to
outweigh the negatives. For both GWWC and non-GWWC pledgers the median
donation exceeds the plan (by around 200 USD).

We do not see striking differences between the GWWC pledgers and non-pledgers by this measure.^[Although the plot loosely suggests that the distribution for GWWC pledgers is shifted slightly to the right as for non-pledgers, the shift appears small. We do not pursue further testing here for several reasons. 1. There are many other differences between these groups. 2. The cross-survey tracked sample is a small share of the total sample. 3. As seen earlier, the base distribution of the *levels* of donations (planned or actual) differs between GWWC and non-GWWC; thus there is no single measure of 'which group comes closer to their plan on average'.
]

-->
<!-- Repeat for another year -->
<p>We next present a scatterplot of planned versus actual donations for
2019, for those who can be matched across surveys. In the figure below,
the brightness of a color indicates the density of respondents (number
of ‘neighbors’) with a particular combination of planned and actual
donations.</p>
<!--
To do, future work

4.  Do across years (not 'for people present in every year' because there are few like that)

-   graph 'mean (and spread?) of p75 actual donations for year XX' versus 'planned donations for year XX'

Later, perhaps it's worth 'modeling' this a bit more formally.

Future work could involve: modeling donation and planned donation more carefully across all years

And further tests
- https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/315601/chi-square-test-alternatives-to-test-for-shift-in-distributions
- Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (for shift in distribution)
- Mann-Whitney test (rank-sum)
- quantile regression or permutation test for difference in
   - medians
   - 75th percentiles of distribution

<p>Overall, the plot is more or less centered around the 45 degree line of
‘plans=actual.’ There are noticeable departures in each direction, but
these seem to balance out. Thus, we might loosely conclude that ‘on
average
441
individuals who can be matched across years tend to donate an amount
close to what they planned.’ However, there may nonetheless be important
differences, so we test further.</p>
<p>Below, we plot donations for these linked individuals – actual
donations are on the left, and planned donations are on the right. We
overlay a ‘violin’ density plot (widths depicts the frequencies).
Medians are depicted in red dots, and the boxes depict 25th and 75th
percentiles. The lines show each individual’s donation (on the left)
connected to her plan (on the right). The plot also reports on a
Wilcoxon signed-rank test (for paired data).</p>

<p>The nonparametric tests reported above find a statistically significant
difference: actual donations tend to exceed planned donations in this
sample, and this difference is unlikely to be due to chance. The
‘pseudo-median’ of this difference is estimated as
281 USD with 95% lower CI
bound 162. The
“matched-pairs rank-biserial correlation” is also bounded between about
0.17 and 0.41, suggesting that “actual donation exceeds planned
donation” is more likely than “planned exceeds actual” (in the
population that this is drawn from).</p>

<p>The mean of ‘actual minus planned’ donations is
1,587 USD, with
simulation-based (bootstrapped) confidence intervals
[-279,
3,454], with
corresponding p-value
0.138. For the median of
this difference we have point estimate
141 USD, with
simulation-based (bootstrapped) confidence intervals
[22.5,
259], with
corresponding p-value
0.102. Thus, the
evidence points towards ‘actual donations exceeding planned donations
for those EAs who can be linked across the past two years.’ <!-- ... However, (unlike in the Wilcoxon signed-rank tests) the differences are not strongly statistically significant in these simulation-based tests. --></p>

<h3>Planned vs. actual: All respondents (across relevant years)</h3>
<p>Those who responded to both 2019 and 2020 surveys (and left emails both
times) might tend to be the more engaged EAs, suggesting that the above figures may be
biased towards more ‘fulfilled plans.’<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>
<p>Thus, we next overlay the planned and actual donations for <em>all

<p>Indeed, ‘2019 respondents who entered a planned donation amount’ (call
these ‘2019-planners’) may not be precisely representative of the
population of interest. Still, we might at least seek an
‘internally-valid’ measure of the ‘distribution of actual 2019 donations
for the 2019-planners,’ and compare their actual to their planned 2019
donations. This will still be imperfect: the composition of the 2019 and
2020 respondents may differ, as discussed elsewhere.</p>
<p>Thus, the distribution of ‘reported 2019 donations for those who
completed the survey in 2020’ (call these ‘2020-reporters’) may be
different from the distribution of the actual 2019 donations made by
2019-planners. The direction and nature of this bias is unclear; we
might get some hints at this by comparing the reported donations in 2018
and 2019 respectively by 2019-reporters and 2020-reporters. If the
distribution of donations changes little from year to year, we might
worry less about this bias. We defer this for future work.</p>
<p>Below, we also report these measures for those who joined EA only before
2019 (plausibly a more stable group).</p>

<p><em>Discussion of above chart:</em></p>
<div class="foldable"><a>Show</a><div class="collapse">
<p>… For 2019 (2020 survey ‘actual’ and 2019 survey ‘planned’) and 2018 (2019
survey ‘actual’ and 2018 survey ‘planned’), the histograms of planned
and actual donations line up approximately (although planned donations
tend to be a bit higher). However, for 2017 (2018 survey ‘actual’ and
2017 survey ‘planned’), the planned donation distribution appears <em>far</em>
lower. This seems likely to result from a different response and a
different composition between the 2017 and 2018 responses.^[There was
an increase in the sample size and the response rate to the donation
questions from 2017 to 2018 below. We report this in the <a href="https://rethinkpriorities.github.io/ea_data_public/eas-donations.html#robust-appendix">bookdown
‘robustness’
appendix</a>.]</p>
<p>(Thus we will <em>not</em> include 2017 in our “planned versus actual”
comparisons.)</p>
<p>As noted, for the remaining relevant donation years (2018 and 2019) the
median donation is somewhat <em>lower than</em> the median planned donation,
suggesting <em>under-performance</em> relative to plans.</p>
</div></div>
<p><strong>Over the most recent years, how do the distributions of planned versus actual donations differ?</strong></p>
<p>In spite of the caveats above, we consider and test whether the distribution of planned donations for a year exceeds or falls short of actual donations, pooling across recient years.
<!-- pooling the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 data (to consider donations vs plans in 2018 and 2019). -->
We do this separately both overall, and excluding those who joined EA only before 2019 (plausibly a more stable group).</p>
<!-- Todo: I want to also do this for a large/consistent set of 'referrers' or 'first heard' group but this will take a lot of cleaning ... see eas_all %>% tabyl(first_hear_ea, year) -->

<p>Above, we give the density of planned and actual donations, split by
year-involved. Vertical lines represent medians for the group and
donation type (green=donation, pink=planned donations). Donations are
bottom-coded at 50 USD. Again, for both groups (where the survey entries
are <em>linked</em>) the <em>planned</em> donation distribution appears to be somewhat
higher than the actual distribution, although the difference is not
dramatic.</p>
<p>We present the results of simulation-based permutation tests below.
<!-- bookdown_start --> (Explanation in fold). <!-- bookdown_end --></p>
<!-- TODO (@oska, medium-highpriority): add the graph of the simulated distribution for the difference in median here for the full sample, with the CI's and point estimates overlaid, and then we can explain it a bit -->
<p><em>Explanation of permutation tests:</em></p>
<div class="foldable"><a>Show</a><div class="collapse">
<p>We use <em>permutation tests</em> for testing whether the median (and mean) of planned donations exceeded/fell short of the mean for actual donations, but using the data from different years’ surveys (without connected individuals).</p>
<p>The null hypothesis (for 2019 donations) is that:</p>
<p>‘there is no difference in the median donation, in our survey sample, between actual 2019 donations (reported in 2020) and planned 2019 donations (reported in 2019).’</p>
<p>Suppose we maintain the hypothesis that</p>
<p>‘individuals appeared in the 2019 survey versus the 2020 survey ’as if randomly drawn’’, and we consider that under the null hypothesis “the distribution of planned and actual donations is identical” (this may be a stronger assumption than needed).</p>
<p>The permutation procedure repeatedly simulates a distribution of planned and actual donations that is consistent with this null, by using our original donation amount data and randomly re-assigning each observation to either ‘planned’ or ‘actual.’ For each ‘simulated null distribution’ we can then compute the targeted statistic (difference between mean/median donation between the two groups). We can plot this ‘simulated null distribution of differences’ and consider ‘how often do we observe a difference as extreme as the ’point estimate’ from our <em>actual</em> data’? This yields the p-values reported below.</p>
<p>The confidence intervals for the differences come from simply using the 95% interval range from the simulated distribution, shifted to be centered around our point estimate.</p>
</div></div>
<p>The figure below presents the simulated null distribution of differences in medians arising from this procedure, for the full sample (2018 - 2019 donation years).</p>
<p>NOTE: we lost the image here</p>
<p><em>Explanation</em>:</p>
<div class="foldable"><a>Show</a><div class="collapse">
<p>The red line gives the point estimate of ‘differences in median between planned and actual’ from our data. The grey bins present the ‘(simulated) distribution of differences between planned and actual, under the null hypothesis that planned and actual are drawn from the same distribution.’</p>
<p>The ‘pink areas’ depict the area of the simulated null distribution that is ‘more extreme’ than our point estimate; this iis the area represented by the ‘p-value’ of a two-tailed hypothesis test.</p>
<p>Finally the turquoise should represent a 95% CI for the actual median;
essentially this comes from a simulated distribution under the hypothesis that the true difference between the medians is exactly equal to our point estimate.</p>
<p>Note that this turquoise region just crosses the 0, again confirming that we ‘just barely cannot reject the null,’ but that a Bayesian analysis would probably put a lot of probability mass on fairly
substantial differences.</p>

medians, and for four distinct subsamples.</p>

<p>For the full sample, for the subset who have been in EA since before
2019, and for GWWC pledgers, both the mean and median donations […] fall
short of the planned donations. Overall, the difference in medians is
bounded between about … <!--  300 and 600 USD. -->
<!-- ... Each of these differences (for the medians) are strongly statistically
significant. Perhaps because of the large outliers, the differences in
means are much more widely bounded, and thus this comparison is largely
uninformative. --></p>
<p>… re-state results… This contrasts with <!-- our results for individuals that can be *matched* across 2019 and 2020 surveys, for whom actual donations tend to *exceed* the reported plans in the prior year.--><a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<!-- Given these contrasting findings, further work might be warranted. If
donations *do* tend to underperform plans, we might look for patterns of
underperformance that might suggest ways of improving this. -->

<p>[…] In each of the years where it was asked, most respondents who answered the retrospective donation question also answered the ‘planned for this year’ question.

<p>The graph’s implications <!-- ...  are not obvious. There is a large mass
*exactly* along the 45 degree line, where the donation amount planned
for the current year equals the amount reported for last year. There
seems to be some substantial mass where planned donations exceed actual
donations (above the 45 degree line), the smoothed curve is largely
positioned at or below this line, perhaps because of the very small and
zero entries for planned donations. --></p>
<p>We repeat the above plot but only for those who report positive values
for both ‘the previous year’ and for ‘planned for this year’:</p>

<!-- ... The median difference is clearly 0 -- the great middle mass of
participants report the same donation planned for the current year as
for the previous one, and this is the case in all resampling
simulations. However, the mean difference is strongly and significantly
positive: if we consider the magnitude of the differences, people tend
to report a greater planned donation for this year than they reported
last year. However, this does *not* necessarily indicate over-optimism
and underperformance: it is possible that the individuals responding to
individual survey in this period in fact *did and do* increase their
donations from year to year. -->

THREE CATEGORIES OF MODEL

As discussed in other posts [and linked material](https://rethinkpriorities.github.io/ea_data_public/eas-engagement.html#modeling-engagement), we broadly imagine three categories of modeling: (See discussion in the fold/footnote.)


1.  Descriptive modeling: Essentially, offering a "dimension reduction"
    of the data, presenting 'which features relate to donation
    behavior'?
2.  Predictive modeling: Training a model to produce the best
    out-of-sample (or out-of-time) fit for current (or future) donations
    based on individual characteristics. This model should not include
    'leaks', i.e., it should excluding individual characteristics and
    outcomes that occur after the time we would be 'doing the
    prediction'.
3.  Causal: Consider identification of 'causal paths', i.e., 'what
    actually determines amounts donated'.

However causal inference requires strong assumptions and/or exogenous
and random shifts in potential determinants of donation behavior. We
don't have any obvious candidates for this in the current setting. At
best, we can interpret our descriptive and predictive models as
suggestive of causal relationships.

-->
<!-- MOVE TO METHODS: WHY DO WE CARE ABOUT CAUSALITY?
We may care about causality

i.  because we see potential to intervene and boost those variables that
    cause greater giving, and/or because

ii. a better understanding of what actually *drives* donation behavior
    may yield additional insights, helping us understand the world
    better.

*However*, we see little potential for very credible and convincing
*causal* inference here. We thus first focus on description (and less
so, prediction), while informally considering 'plausible causation'. We
discuss (and implement) this in the [next section](#descriptive).
(Discussion in bookdown/fold
[HERE](https://rethinkpriorities.github.io/ea_data_public/eas-donations.html#modeling-questions-and-approaches)).


Consider factors of potential interest, including those we could
influence as a movement (e.g., 'recommended career paths') and those of
fundamental interest (perhaps income, age or initial cause
prioritization). Simply looking at differences in donation by these
measures will not tell us their actual *impact* on donation; nor will a
'controlled regression': each of these are likely to be related to, and
influenced by (observable and) unobserved components which may also
drive donations.

E.g., suppose people who first went to an elite university tended to
donate more. This would *not* this mean that attending an elite
university causes greater donations. Individuals who attend elite
university may have greater exposure to EA charitable appeals, or
greater (unobserved wealth) or lifetime income, which may independently
cause greater giving. Even age cannot be given an obvious causal
interpretation, given our sample selection; e.g., in any sample we look
at the older people will tend to have joined EA at a younger age, and
people may have been driven to join at a younger age *because* they were
more altruistic, or because they had a stronger EA peer network, etc.

For these reasons, we general look for sources of experimental or
quasi-experimental variation in the factors of interest to justify
causal inference. However, these are not present in our data.

-->
<!--
As mentioned in the introduction, being able to *predict* donations
could be useful for several reasons. Thus, we follow our descriptive
models with ["predictive models"](#predictive-models), with different
goals and approaches, including elements of machine learning (see
further discussion [below](#predictive-models)).

In this year's post we begin with a set of pre-specified models aimed at
describing and providing suggestive inference about causal factors
driving donations. (Further discussion in the [Bookdown at this
point](https://rethinkpriorities.github.io/ea_data_public/eas-donations.html#descriptive))

<p><em>Brief: our descriptive model ‘selection’</em></p>
<div class="foldable"><a>Show</a><div class="collapse">
<p>In our <em>descriptive</em> modeling we do <em>not</em> remove ‘insignificant’ features from the model (as in stepwise regression), nor do we shrink the coefficients towards zero (as in Ridge and Lasso models). Under the assumptions of the classical linear model and its simple extensions the coefficients we present here would be unbiased or consistent. (However, we admit that the strong assumptions of this model, particularly those embodying exogeneity, are likely to fail in important ways in the current non-experimental setting.)</p>

<p>We retain those features of most direct interest (such as ‘how introduced to EA’) and/or theoretical importance (such as income),<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> and ‘controls’ (especially time-in-EA and survey-year) that might allow us to better interpret the features of interest.<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<p>Above, we report donations, income, career, and GWWC pledge rates. … <!-- ... XXX Note
that the 'Don. avg.', the average of the current year and planned
donation, is close, but slightly above the 'Donation' variable, and has
somewhat more positive values. Note also that income imputation (where
missing or stated as below 5000 USD) recodes about 10% of these values,
and leads to a fairly similar average income figure (compare 'Income
(not imp.)' and 'Income (imp. bc.)', where the latter refers to the
income imputation and bottom-coding at 5000 USD). Note that, perhaps
unsurprisingly, the rates of self-reported 'earning-to-give' careers and
'having ever made a Giving What We Can pledge' is higher among those in
this sample (those who report a donation) than in the overall EAS

only, with roughly … <!-- equal --> shares of each year <!-- (although somewhat fewer in
each subsequent year). --> … The largest (or plurality) demographic groups (as
in the sample overall, see other posts) are <!-- male, non-students, of
'white' ethnicity, and from the US. At least 43% come from one of cities
named in the EA survey (over 50% of those responding), and 13% (where we

# TODO --------------------------------------------------------------------
# Consider imputation (especially for income variable) #DR: the ad-hoc imputation we've used so far is probably good enough for now
## Should this be done before normalizing? #DR: it shouldn't matter, but yeah, it seems like better practice to impute before normalizing
-->
</div>
<div id="models-tables-and-plots-of-results-latest-years-combined" class="section level4 unnumbered">
<h4>Models (tables and plots of results; latest years combined)</h4>
<p>We put together forest plots of (normalized) coefficients from the distinct set of models outlined above, where these can be compared on the same scales. Specifically, we consider,</p>
<ul>
<li>for each of the three key outcomes (‘amount donated (averaged),’
‘donation as a share of income,’ ‘donated over 1000 USD’),</li>
<li>models with three specific sets of features, yielding nine models in total (plus robustness checks in the appendix).</li>
</ul>
<p>The feature sets, which we will refer to in the forest plots below, are:</p>
<p><strong>1. “Base”</strong> (baseline model)</p>
<p>Demographics:<a href="#fn33" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a>
Log age, Gender, Student, Race/ethnicity, Where live, City</p>
<p>Career-related:
Employed PT, Not Employed, Top-6 Uni.</p>
<p>Controls:
Years in EA (log), Year of survey</p>
<!-- "imp" denotes that income is imputed where missing"-->
<p><em>Logit model: standardizations:</em></p>
<div class="foldable"><a>Show</a><div class="collapse">
<p>For the Logit models we use standardizations instead of logged continuous variables. We divide age and tenure by two sample standard deviations for each, following <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-gelmanScalingRegressionInputs2008" role="doc-biblioref">Gelman</a> (<a href="#ref-gelmanScalingRegressionInputs2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>. This allows the coefficients of continuous features like income to be compared to those for binary features like “whether employed.” We divide income by the sample inter-quartile range (Error in h(simpleError(msg, call)) :
error in evaluating the argument ‘x’ in selecting a method for function ‘format’: missing values and NaN’s not allowed if ‘na.rm’ is FALSE
USD). As the distribution appears highly skewed, normalizing income by 2sd would yield extremely large and hard-to-interpret coefficients.</p>
</div></div>
<p><strong>2. “Robust controls”:</strong> Including all of the features in <em>Base</em> as well as a second term for each of “Years in EA (log), Log age” that takes a positive value only where these exceed their respective sample medians, and is otherwise set to zero. These represent ‘adjustment terms’ allowing us to see whether and how time-in-EA, age, and income may have a different relationship with donations at higher values of each of these.<a href="#fn34" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a></p>
<!--
**3. "Base + Robust + First heard":** Including all of the features in *Robust controls* as well as binary variables for "where first heard of EA".^[Here we use the robust controls to 'robustly control' for nonlinear background effects that might be entangled with 'where first heard of EA'.
]
-->
<p><strong>3. “Base + ETG + GWWC”:</strong> Including all of the features in <em>Base</em> as
well as the binary variables
“GWWC (ever), EtG,”
i.e., whether reported ever having taken the Giving What We Can Pledge,
and whether they report their career as ‘earning-to-give.’</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Note that we report models with <em>each of the three feature sets</em> in each of the forest plots below. However, each forest plot reports on a single outcome and a single ‘theme,’ e.g., focusing on reporting just the coefficients on demographics from across <em>each of the above three model feature sets</em> (with some repeated coefficients across plots).</p>
<p><strong>These themes are</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Demographics (including age and time-in-EA)*</li>
<li>Employment/career, GWWC, EtG, Income**</li>
<li>“Non-response” to particular questions (in the appendix)***</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it is important to remember that the reported estimates in each forest plot come from models that ‘control for’ other features (as reported).</p>
<p>Note that we exclude the ‘two-part’ coefficients (in the ‘Robust controls’ models) from the forest plots.<a href="#fn35" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>We present the coefficients on ‘Age, Time in EA, Income, and nonlinear
adjustments for each of these’ <a href="eas_donations.html#nonlin">in a separate set of tables</a>

<p>In the figure above, the vertical bar at “1” represents the coefficient of “no difference in donation between these groups, all else equal.” … (possible brief discussion of key results here, or only in Forum post). <!--  ... As all of the 95% confidence intervals cross this line (for City, just barely), we cannot rule out 'no difference' by conventional frequentist null-hypothesis testing.

Still, the evidence suggests that (all else equal), individuals from big cities named in the EA survey donate substantially more.^[We did not run a Bayesian analysis here. However, in our experience such approaches, under a flat prior belief, put most of the posterior probability mass within similar ranges as do the frequentist confidence intervals. This would suggest we could be fairly confident that (e.g.) those from big EA cities tend to donate more, all else equal. However, further, explicit Bayesian analysis might be merited.
]

Point estimates imply they donate about... more/less <!-- XXX 18-19% more on average (considering our baseline model and our model with robust controls), or about 25% more on average, when we also adjust for earning-to-give and GWWC status.^[However, GWWC and EtG can be seen as very closely related to the outcome we are looking for; thus, even in a descriptive sense, this coefficient is hard to interpret in model 3.
] --></p>
<p><!-- seems to have very little relationship to donation here, or at least we have little evidence to suggest a relationship. The coefficients on "Not just white" are close to zero, with wide 95% confidence intervals. --></p>

<!--
Similarly to above, those who report ever having taken the GWWC pledge,
and those who report being in an Earning-to-Give career tend to donate a
much larger *share of income* than the rest, all else equal.
Specifically, over *twice as large a share* for GWWC, and over 50% more
for EtG.

We see similar patterns as above for top-6 university and for those who
are not employed. However the results for part-time employer contrast to
the previous plot. While the part-time employed tend to donate somewhat
more overall, they tend to donate a lower *share of their income* than
the base group (the full-time employed), all else equal. (Again, recall
that this already controls for income and other factors.)

<p>In the Baseline model… we see that, unsurprisingly, donations clearly and strongly increase in income, all else equal; <!--...  XXX I don't expect this to change though -->in the parlance of Economics, donation seems to be a ‘Normal good.’ The estimated income elasticity is 0.951, suggesting that, all else equal, on average, as income increases in our data by some share ‘X,’ donations increase by slightly … <!-- less--> than this share. <!-- I.e. donations increase slightly less than proportionally with income, suggesting that donation are not a 'luxury good' in the strict Econ-1 sense. However, the upper confidence interval is still somewhat above 1 (and the usual caveats about sample selection, unobservable factors, and causality apply).--></p>
<p>In model 2 we include an adjustment coefficient to allow nonlinearity, allowing the elasticity of donations in income to be distinct for income levels above the median. … <!-- XXX ... This coefficient is positive (very loosely suggesting that, for above-average levels of income, greater income leads to proportionally greater donations) but it is very small, and we cannot rule out zero difference. Arguably, the fact that even the upper confidence interval for this adjustment is rather small speaks against a very strong nonlinearity, and in favor of a 'proportional donations' model as a starting point. --></p>
<p>Age: <!-- XXX ...  has a ...positive relationship to donation; --> the baseline coefficient suggests that as age doubles, contributions increase by 50.6% on average, all else equal.
…<!-- Model 2 suggests that this 'age relationship' is approximately proportional in this way, with only a small (and statistically insignificant) positive adjustment for ages above the median (age 28). --></p>
<p>Time-in-EA is strongly related to donations, <!-- XXX doublecheck...--> even ‘controlling for age, etc.’ (and vice versa). A doubling of years in EA is associated with a 62.7% greater donation. The nonlinear adjustment term … <!-- is again fairly small and statistically insignificant.--></p>
<p>Each of the ‘survey year difference’ estimates (for 2019 and 2020, with 2018 as the base year) are (… update/doublecheck) fairly close to 1 (representing ‘no difference’). However, 95% confidence intervals are rather … wide, suggesting a lack of statistical power to discern a difference. … <!-- XXX ^[This suggests that we may have little power to discern whether (all else equal) there are strong differences between donations among respondents to each survey, all else equal. Still, our best guess might be something close to a zero difference, and we might reasonably put substantial probability that any differences are not extremely large. (Strictly speaking, we would need to estimate Bayesian credible intervals to make statements like this; we use the standard frequentist confidence intervals somewhat imprecisely.)

<p>We next present the corresponding coefficients for our fractional logit models of ‘donations as a share of income.’</p>

<p>The baseline models suggest that donation as a share of income is roughly (… constant, or slightly increasing in income. For every doubling of income, the <em>share of income</em> donated is seen to increase by 4.5%. … <!-- XXX ... While the 95% confidence intervals include small decreases or increases in this share as income doubles (from about -5% to +13%), the evidence suggests approximate proportionality. Model 2 suggests this pattern continues at larger incomes, with little apparent nonlinearity above median income (and fairly tight bounds on this). --></p>
<p>Discussion (or forum only): age vs donation share…
<!-- Age is very strongly positively associated with 'donation as a share of income', with a doubling of age approximately relating to a 81.9% increase in share of income donated (i.e., more than a doubling of this share, on average, all other observables held constant).^[We want to emphasize each of these coefficients 'hold other observable things constant'. E.g., age has the mentioned very strong relationship to share of income donated---even holding time-in-EA constant and vice versa.
]
--></p>
<!-- ... report Years-in-EA also shows a very strong association to share of income donated, with a doubling of this 'tenure' approximately relating to a 59.7% increase in share of income donated.

The adjustment coefficients for each of these are small and fairly-tightly bounded, suggesting perhaps only small differences in the above relationships for values of age and tenure above the medians.

In these models we *do* find some statistically significant associations between survey year and share-of-income donated, all else equal, with 2019 and 2020 generally having lower values than 2018. However, we do not want to read too much into this, given possible differences in survey response composition, as discussed in other posts.

<p>We use elastic-net and random-forest modeling approaches with validation (these are standard in the modern ‘machine learning’ tooklit), to derive a model that ‘predicts well.’*</p>

</p>
<p><em>Discussion: why build ‘predictive models of donation?’ :</em></p>
<div class="foldable"><a>Show</a><div class="collapse">
<p><strong>TODO: move (some?) of this to methods section</strong></p>
<p>We focus on predicting the individual’s donation in a year, focusing on the same set of outcomes used in the previous section. For this model to be useful for an <em>actual</em> prediction problem going forward, it would need to rely on ‘ex-ante’ characteristic that were already observable at the time of a career/EtG/pledge decision.<a href="#fn45" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> These might include immutable demographics, career plans, and pledges previously taken, and consider year and trend effects.</p>
<p>Although we have these models in mind, this is not what we are doing here. We are not posing a specific ‘prediction problem’ per se. Instead we are using machine learning tools built for prediction problems to generate ‘data-driven insights’ about factors related to EA donation behavior. Here, we do not than directly specifying all of the included components of the model (features, interaction terms, etc.). Instead we provide a large set of possible ‘inputs’ and use ML techniques to train models that should predict well <em>outside of the data they are trained on</em>. These models should do a good job of accomplishing the task: ‘if you gave me a set of features of an EA, I should have a fairly accurate guess at what they will donate.’</p>
<p>The insights from these models should also be treated with caution. Again, they may not be deriving causal relationships. Furthermore, the parameters derived from model-fitting ML procedures are not in general unbiased or consistent, and it is difficult to derive proper confidence intervals for these parameters.</p>
<p>Still, the benefit of this exercise may be considered ‘the derivation of robust and predictive relationships in the data that are mainly driven by the data itself, rather than our preconcieved ideas.’ These models may also be useful building blocks towards future predictive work.</p>

<p>In brief, the <em>elastic net</em> models involve linear models (log-linear in
our case), i.e., ‘<em>regressions</em>,’ that carefully ‘penalize’ the
(squared) magnitude of coefficients, in effect shrinking these towards
zero. The penalties are specifically ‘tuned’ and ‘validated’ to maximize
the predictive power of the model. As these are essentially regression
approaches, we can report the sign and magnitude of the coefficients
used in the ‘optimally tuned’ predictive model. (However, we should be
careful about interpreting these parameters, and statistical inference
is challenging. See e.g., <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Mullainathan2017" role="doc-biblioref">Mullainathan &amp; Spiess</a> (<a href="#ref-Mullainathan2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017a</a>)</span> for a detailed discussion.)</p>

<div class="foldable"><a>Show</a><div class="collapse">
<p><strong>TODO: move (some?) of this to methods section</strong></p>
<p><em>Decision tree</em> models (which we do not report on here) take a different
approach, attempting to discern optimal ways to split the data into
conditional groups (e.g., ‘income over 20k’) and subgroups (e.g.,
‘students versus nonstudents with income below 20k’), and finally making
a prediction for each subgroup at the ‘bottom of the tree.’ The <em>random
forest</em> approach extends the above to allow a sort of averaging across
an ensemble of trees that are derived independently, each selecting a
random subset of the features.</p>
</div></div>
<p>We fit these models/approaches, starting with a wide set of potential features, to explain each of the three main outcomes considered above.<a href="#fn46" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> Below, we plot the seven most ‘important’ features (aka variables) for predicting the log of donation amount (average of planned and actual, where available) according to the random forest and elastic net (‘regression’) models.</p>
<!-- DR, @Oska -- surprisingly, I don't see d_gwwc_ever_0. Was this dropped? I actually think it *should* be dropped (as well as  perhaps d_career_etg), as these seem way too leaky/collidery. But I'm wondering what actually went on and how and why it might have been dropped.
Also, should/could we allow interactions and quadratic terms at all?

<!-- Work is in `donation_pred.R`

Consider sensitivity to outliers -- possibly do prediction for those below 500k income -->

<p>Above, we report the ‘importance scores’ for the ten most important features (‘variables’) for two distinct approaches to predicting log (average) donation.<a href="#fn47" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p>These importance scores are technically defined <a href="https://topepo.github.io/caret/variable-importance.html#model-specific-metrics">here</a>. For the elastic net (“linear reg”) approach, we depict the coefficients’ signs with a “+” or “-”; for tree/forest-based modeling this is less straightforward.</p>
<p>Most important predictors… <!-- XXX brief discussion here? further discussion in Forum?--></p>
<!-- ...  XXX Income (normalized, bottom-coded at 5000 USD, and logged) is the most important predictor in for each model, by a wide margin. After this, the relative importances vary. E.g., the random forest model deems age and student status to be particularly important, while linear model does not; in turn the linear model puts substantial importance on non-response to the student status question, but the random forest modeling does not. Both put substantial importance on years involved and 'not employed' statuses. Considering 'where one first-heard of EA', the linear model finds nonresponse and (to a lesser extent) GiveWell to be positively related and important, and 80000 hours to be negatively related to the predicted donation. It also finds Earning to Give to be somewhat important (and positively related), but perhaps to a lesser extent than we might have expected.

<p>As our data exhibited some large donation-amount outliers, (which is naturally tied to high income), we re-trained models on a subset of the data with only respondents who earned less than $500,000, with importance scores reported below.</p>

<p>The results are … <!-- very similar. Again income is still the most important predictor for both models. The ranking of variables, and the importance scores are generally similar to the 'unfiltered' model above.^[Earning to give is no longer one of the 'top 10 most important' features, while having heard of EA through LessWrong shows up as fairly important and negative in the linear model. However, this may tell us more about the variance and sensitivity of the importance scores in these prediction model approaches than about any real differences in the correlates of donations.

<!-- ... XXX
(Log) Income is deemed highly important as a predictor of *share* of income donated, in the random forest models but not in the regression models.^[We speculate that this might be due to mechanical differences in the models: while a linear model allows predicted donations shares to 'continuously scale with income', the random forest modeling needs to use discrete 'branches'. Also note that we explored the relationship between donations and income and income shares in more detail above, particularly in the final section of our [descriptive modeling](#nonlin).
]
--></p>
<p>Both types of models (discuss here or in forum only…) <!-- XXX  assign some importance to age and years involved; but this is much stronger in the random forest (in the linear models these have positive signs but only middling importance). On the other hand, while both also assign importance to reporting that one 'could not remember or determine where they first heard of EA'; this is much stronger in the linear model (where it is deemed the most important feature, and it has a positive sign). Overall, the importance scores are rather divergent. The linear models assign some importance (and positive sign) to people indicating that they first heard of EA through 'Raising for Effective Giving, EA Funds, the Foundational Research Institute or the "Swiss group"', through GWWC and related 'pledge/charity orgs', and, to a much lesser extent, through GiveWell or through a Ted Talk.^[We recognize that these 'first-heard' groupings are somewhat ad-hoc and only moderately homogeneous. This may merit future work. Note also that the random forest models also put some importance on the nonlinear 'years involved term'.

'learning about EA', with 'Ted Talks', 'GWWC and related', and (less so)

<h4>Model Performance</h4>
<p>We consider ‘how well these models predict.’ Overall, these models offer (…) some predictive power. E.g., note that about 46% of the relevant sample reports over 1k in donations. Our logistic regression model can correctly predict … <!--- 75% of these outcomes with a false-positive rate of around 25%.^[In comparison, a predictor that did not condition on observables could only correctly 'catch' 75% of these outcomes if it (randomly) predicted this outcome over 75% of the time, leading to a false-positive rate over 75%. -->
]</p>
<p><em>Discussion: measuring prediction success :</em></p>
<div class="foldable"><a>Show</a><div class="collapse">
<p>We may want to consider ‘how successful’ our predictive models are at
making practically useful predictions. In other words, ‘how far off’ are
the predictions and classifications on average, from the actual
outcomes. This procedure considers the fit on randomly-drawn <em>set-aside</em>
‘testing data,’ data that has not been used in ‘training’ (or ‘fitting’)
the model. Below, we consider some commonly-used metrics.</p>
</div></div>
<div id="regression-model-performance" class="section level5 unnumbered">
<h5>Regression Model Performance</h5>
<p>In order to assess the usefulness of each predictive regression model we consider both root-mean-square-error (RMSE) and mean-absolute-error (MAE).</p>
<p><em>Computing RMSE:</em></p>
<div class="foldable"><a>Show</a><div class="collapse">
<p>NOTE: probably move this to the methods book</p>
<p>RMSE (aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation">RMSD</a>) can be interpreted as the average ‘Euclidean distance’ between the actual values and the model’s prediction. For each observation (in the set-aside ‘testing sample’), to construct RMSE we:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Measure the differences between the actual and predicted outcome (e.g., donation), 2. Square these differences</li>
<li>Take the average of these squared differences across all observations, 4. Take the square root of this</li>
</ol>
</div></div>
<p><em>Computing MAE :</em></p>
<div class="foldable"><a>Show</a><div class="collapse">
<p>NOTE: probably move this to the methods book</p>
<p>To construct mean-absolute-error (MAE) we simply 1. Measure the <em>absolute-value</em> differences between the actual and predicted outcome (e.g., donation) for each observation. 2. Take the average of these across all observations</p>
<p>MAE has a much more straightforward interpretation: it simply asks ‘how far off are we, on average?’</p>
</div></div>
<p><em>Use of RMSE vs MAE :</em></p>
<div class="foldable"><a>Show</a><div class="collapse">
<p>NOTE: probably move this to the methods book</p>
<p>While the RMSE is used in the model <em>fitting</em> for various reasons, it is arguably less-interpretable and less-relevant than MAE in <em>judging</em> the model’s fit in cases like this one. RMSE error negatively assesses the model fit based on <em>squared</em> deviations, and is thus very sensitive to ‘large mistakes.’ This may be relevant where ‘large errors are much much worse than small ones’ – here, this is not so clearly the case. In the presence of data with large outlying observations, prediction will tend to be poor by this measure.</p>
<p>To address this we: 1. Present both RMSE and MAE 2. Re-run the models of (log average) <em>donations</em> for the subset of individuals with incomes at or below 500,000 USD. For this subset, there are fewer influential donation outliers.</p>
<p>The latter also allows us to consider how sensitive the <em>model fit</em> is to outliers.</p>
</div></div>
<p><em>Dealing with transformed outcomes :</em></p>
<div class="foldable"><a>Show</a><div class="collapse">
<p>NOTE: probably move this to the methods book</p>
<p>Note that when considering models where the outcome is transformed (e.g., log(donations)) we construct the RMSE and MAE by exponentiating to generate predictions for the <em>level</em> outcomes, and then measure the deviations on the level scale.</p>
<p>When considering predicted outcomes on the <em>logarithmic</em> scale, both RMSE and MAE indicate roughly ‘how many exponential orders of magnitude our predictions for the <em>non-logged outcomes</em> are off. E.g., a MSE of 1.5 for ’log donation’ suggests an we are off by about <span class="math inline">\(exp(1.5) =\)</span> 4.48 times in terms of donations, getting them off by a factor of about 5. This conversion avoids such complications.</p>

<p>How does this compare to a ‘naive model’ in which we predict the average donation for everyone? Note that for the comparable unfiltered data, the mean absolute deviation is 13,306 and the standard deviation is 106,109. The predictive model reduces this uncertainty substantially (…).</p>

<p><em>Discussion: ROC curve, AUC:</em></p>
<div class="foldable"><a>Show</a><div class="collapse">
<p>NOTE: probably move this to the methods book</p>
<p>An ROC curve plots the true positive rate (sensitivity) as a function of the false positive rate (1-specificity). Here the true positive rate gives the rate at which our model correctly predicts a respondent to donate over $1000, with the false positive rate giving the rate at which these predictions are incorrect.</p>
<p>Better classifiers will have an ROC curve that is further North-West, with the perfect classifier being an L-shaped curve passing through <span class="math inline">\((0,0) \rightarrow(0,1) \rightarrow(1,1)\)</span>. Where classifiers ROC curves do not cross, it is clear that one will be performing better than another. That is not the case here. Both models seem to be performing relatively similarly, with the ROC curves overlapping somewhat. It is difficult to discern which model is performing the best, and this will depend on our criterion.</p>
<p>However, both models yield curves substantially above the 45 degree line, thus substantially outperforming an uninformed classifier. For example, if we are willing to accept about a 25% rate of false positives (falsely predicting a 1k+ donation), the logistic regression model correctly predicts about 75% of true positives (and the random forest model about 73%).</p>
<p>We can use the area under the curve (AUC) measure to compare classifiers
for all costs of misclassification. This measure quantifies how close
the ROC curve is to the optimal L-shaped curve.</p>

<h3>‘Saved to donate later’</h3>
<p><strong>Added 30 Oct 2021</strong></p>
<div class="rmdnote">
<p>A <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/nb6tQ5MRRpXydJQFq/ea-survey-2020-series-donation-data?commentId=gx95kaca5owGxsktf">comment from
TylerMaule</a>
prompted us to revisit this question.</p>
</div>
<p>In 2020, after the main donation questions, we also asked</p>
<p>Are you presently saving money to donate later, rather than
donate now? If so, roughly how much money are you planning
to save in 2020 for this purpose?</p>
<p>We report on this only briefly here. We did not emphasize it for several
reasons.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>It is unclear how much this responses reflects a strong intention or
commitment (e.g., a DAF contribution) that will be manifested in
actual later donations. The amount someone reports they are
“presently saving … to donate later” could express only a a vague
intention to donate late and may be subject to them changing their
mind, changes in financial circumstance, or value drift.</p></li>
<li><p>It is difficult to aggregate this savings with <em>actual</em> donations,
as this could lead to double-counting. However, reporting all
results for both measures (saving and actual donations) could make
this report bulky.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>However, we hope to look more closely at saving-to-donate behavior in
future. This may be particularly relevant for <a href="https://80000hours.org/2020/08/the-emerging-school-of-patient-longtermism/">patient
longtermists</a>.</p>

<p>The above presentation is meant to be broadly descriptive. Overall, it
appears that those who prioritize long-term causes tend to donate a bit
less at median but more at mean, and there is a lot of overlap between
the two groups.</p>

<p>We report the amount people say they expect to donate in the current
(survey) year below. Note the high share of missing values for 2017, and
the substantially-larger sample in 2018. As noted above, this suggests
that comparing the planned donations for 2018 (in EA survey 2018) to
actual donations for 2018 (reported in 2019 EA survey) may not be
informative.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.10.3</span> Donation shares by income (by US-residence, 2019)</h3>
<p>By request, we consider median and mean shares of income donated,
separately tallying for US residents and others. This allows us to
compare donation rates to those reported for the US overall. In
particular, <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-meer2020" role="doc-biblioref">Meer &amp; Priday</a> (<a href="#ref-meer2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> reports a roughly 1.6-2.1% percent share of income
donated throughout all of the US income quantiles (except or the lowest
5%). The statistics below suggest that EAs who fill out the donation
questions in the survey to donate a greater share of their income,
perhaps at least twice as much.</p>
<p>Recall that the <em>mean</em> share of <em>total</em> (imputed) income donated (for
2019) was 9.4% (imputing income where
below 5k or missing).</p>
<p>If we focus on US-resident nonstudents across all years, the mean share
is 7.94%.</p>

<p>We could also ‘average the individual shares donated’; as this is highly
sensitive to outliers (e.g., people with the lowest incomes reporting
donating many times this share), we ‘Winsorise,’ capping each
individual’s ‘share of income donate’ at some percent. Following this
procedure and capping at 20%, the mean share of income donated, across
all years, for US-resident non-students in the EA survey, is
5.67%.</p>
<p>We plot donation shares on a log scale, for US and non-US residents
separately (across all years). Below, the blue dash gives us the median
for USA (vs non-USA), and the smoothed curve tries to best fit the mean.
The left graph is ‘Winsorised’ at 20%, and right one at 40%</p>

<li id="fn2"><p>All figures here refer to survey responses, so we won’t write ‘reported in the survey’ each time. These (2019-20) numbers exclude a single survey donation response in the billions that was ruled to be implausible. A total of NA observations were dropped for implausible income, donations, or ages. Averages are for those who answered the donation question(s), including those who reported donating zero. Nonresponses are not counted in these statistics except where specifically mentioned. Unless otherwise mentioned, all figures simply add, average or otherwise summarize individual responses from the EA Survey years mentioned.<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>Many respondents do not reveal their income, or report zero or implausibly small incomes (if we consider income to include transfers and family support); among these, many <em>do</em> report donations. To get a meaningful measure of average shares of income donated (and other stats) <em>including</em> these individuals, we need to put some measure reflecting yearly spending power in the denominator. We thus make a rough imputation, selecting the average income for individuals from their same country and same student-status who <em>do</em> report an income value. To avoid sensitivity to outliers, countries with small numbers of participants are lumped together into an “other” group for this imputation. Where this (or reported income) falls below 5000 USD, we ‘bottom-code’ it this as at 5000 USD. (Note that we hope to improve this imputation in future work, incorporating features such as age in the imputation.)<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref3" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>We do not include 2014 in the above tables and plots because of very low response rates to the student status and EtG-relevant questions.<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref4" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>Note, we report on amounts ‘planning [to] save in 2020 to donate later in an <a href="eas_donations.html#save-to-don">appendix section</a>.’<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref5" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>Here we impute income where it is missing or below 5000 USD. However, the figure <em>removes</em> observations where income as well one of either country or student status is missing; in these cases income cannot be simply imputed from these.<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref6" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>We have shown ‘where the donations were in 2019’ (and across years). However, we are <em>not</em> suggesting that this provides direct evidence of differences in EA generosity by country.<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref7" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>In stratifying donation and income statistics by employment/student status we exclude those who gave no information on this question (or who answered that they prefer not to answer). (These nonresponses make up 20.4% of the sample).<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref8" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>Note that thus is reporting means and not medians. The ‘self-employed’ group clearly reflects outliers, and its upper CI is truncated at 30000 to save space.<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref9" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>… update to new data The UK clearly contains
some notable donation outliers, leading to very large confidence
intervals for the UK mean (truncated above at 30000 USD).<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref10" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>As discussed in <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/4xczoALF6adpQk3TN/ea-survey-2020-engagement#__Selection_and_differential_attrition__focus_on_recent__2017_2019__recruits___">other

this may be reflecting differences in <em>who</em> stays in EA (and continues

<li id="fn19"><p>These EAs, who happened to respond to the survey in both years and give a matchable email, may not be typical EAs; we discuss this further below.<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref19" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn20"><p>As the distribution of values is highly negatively skewed, we present this on a logarithmic scale, with values from 0-50 USD ‘bottom-coded’ as 50 USD.<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref20" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn21"><p>However, note that we are currently considering these <em>distributions</em>
rather than the individual differences for linked individuals’; we
present the latter in the next subsection.<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref21" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn22"><p>In particular, having
fulfilled one’s planned donation might make one more likely to want to
complete the follow-up survey, and perhaps more keen to provide one’s
<em>donation</em> data in particular.<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref22" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn23"><p>Here we compare the ‘amounts planned
for the year of a survey’ to the ‘amounts reported for the previous
year, in the following year’s survey.’ We do this separately for each
available year. While this offers us a larger sample, and may be less vulnerable to the bias just-mentioned, it brings up other sample selection issues, and
these comparisons should also be treated with some caution (see fold/footnote).<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref23" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn24"><p>As noted earlier, this contrast might be because people who <em>have</em> met or exceeded their donation plans are more likely to respond to surveys in subsequent years, and report donations in each. As discussed earlier, for the ‘matched individuals’ (those who can be linked from 2019 and 2020 surveys) the mean and median of the distribution of actual donations exceeds that of planned, but these differences are not statistical significant in the permutation tests. However, for the matched individuals, these differences are positive and significant (or close to significant) in tests that take advantage of the linked nature of this data and look at the individual differences themselves.<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref24" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn25"><p>Classical economic theory suggests that most goods are ‘normal,’ with the amount consumed increasing in income. Empirical evidence supports this for charitable giving; <a href="https://econofact.org/are-rich-people-really-less-generous">recent work</a> suggests that <em>share of income</em> is relatively constant across the income distribution, implying that wealthier people give more in absolute terms.<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref25" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn26"><p>As discussed in <a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/tzFcqGmCA6ePeD5wm/ea-survey-2020-how-people-get-involved-in-ea">other posts</a> ‘how people were introduced to EA’ has changed over the years. We also expect those who have been involved in EA for a longer period of time to be more engaged, and perhaps donate more (possibly due to differential attrition). Thus, it seems reasonable that in tracking the association between donation and introducer, we might want to ‘control for’ (difference out or hold constant) the differences in ‘time-in-EA’ between these groups. Still, we admit that these specifications are not based on an explicit causal model or identification strategy.<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref26" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn27"><p>“Top-6 university” refers to whether the individual lists any of the six universities (Oxford, Stanford, Harvard, CalTech, MIT, Cambridge) appearing in the top-10 of all of USNWR, QS, and THE rankings. However, university was not asked in the 2018 survey <a href="eas_donations.html#fnref27" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn28"><p>We refer to the latter as “controls” because they aid our
interpretation of other features of interest, as noted above.
However, these are <em>also</em> of independent interest.<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref28" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn29"><p>Here we focus on the average of last-year’s and next year’s donation for each individual, where both are present, and otherwise we use whichever one is present. In the presence of recall and reporting error, we expect this will improve the reliability of our estimates. The <a href="eas_donations.html#plan-actual">plots and figures above</a> also suggest that planned and actual donations are closely related. We report a set of related results for the simpler donation outcome in the robustness appendix.<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref29" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn30"><p>Where income is missing or where income was reported as 0 we impute it based on student status and country.<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref30" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn31"><p>We report log-linear models in the robustness appendix.<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref31" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn32"><p>We focus on the ‘average of planned and actual, where present, otherwise the non-missing value.’ Although this outcome variable is continuous (and this cannot strictly follow a Poisson distribution, the quasi-poisson model is still able to obtain consistent parameter estimates, provided that the conditional mean is correctly specified <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-silvaLOGGRAVITY2006" role="doc-biblioref">Silva &amp; Tenreyro, 2006</a>)</span>.<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref32" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn33"><p>“log” notes
that the natural log was taken (allowing a proportional ‘elasticity’
relationship).<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref33" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn34"><p>This simple ‘two part’ specification is partially related to the DataColada discussion <a href="http://datacolada.org/62">here</a>.<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref34" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn35"><p>In the ‘Robust controls’ model there are two coefficients for each of age, income and ‘time in EA’ for below-median values, and a second one representing the adjustment to this coefficient for above-median values of each of these. We leave these coefficients out of the forest plots to avoid confusion, reporting them in tables under “<a href="eas_donations.html#nonlin">Age, time-in-EA, Income, year; possible nonlinearity</a>” instead.<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref35" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn36"><p>We use the natural log of income in our models of donation amounts and ‘donation/income’ outcome. Here the (untransformed) coefficients have an elasticity interpretation — percent increase in donations (or donation share) for a given percentage increase in income. As this scale is not comparable to our other coefficients, we do not report it in these forest plots. We report this in tables under “<a href="eas_donations.html#nonlin">Age, time-in-EA, Income; possible nonlinearity</a>” instead
.<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref36" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn37"><p>To avoid clutter we present the results for nonresponse feature set in an
<a href="https://rethinkpriorities.github.io/ea_data_public/eas-donations.html#nonresponse">appendix tableonly</a>.<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref37" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn38"><p>Again, we want to emphasize that each these are from
models which also ‘control’ for a wide set of characteristics (e.g.,
income, age, and time-in-EA), as catalogued above.<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref38" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn39"><p>The exponentiated coefficients presented here can be interpreted as ‘in considering average donations for each group, by what amount should we multiply this if we look at an individual with the variable ’switched on’ versus switched off’, all else equal’? For continuous variables, it expresses ’how much do we multiply this if we increase our the variable by one (normalized) measure?<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref39" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn40"><p>Where income is imputed where 0 or below 5000, as explained above. Here, we topcode the (relatively few) responses that report donations in excess of income to have a value of 1 (donated 100% of income.) As in all of these plots, these are from models containing the three broad sets of features outlined above, including (the log of) reported income; thus we do not impose an exact proportional relationship between income and donations.<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref40" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn41"><p>Note – this <em>doesn’t</em> mean they donate 20 more percentage points of their income; the share of the income they donate, on average, is 20% larger. E.g., if a group of non-big-EA-city-people donated 10% of their income on average, we might expect a comparable big-EA-city group of people to donate 12% of their income on average.<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref41" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn42"><p>Here we also present the normalized age coefficient. Recall, for the models of <em>other outcomes</em> we present age in a later table, in elasticity terms)<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref42" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn43"><p>We consider the relationship between income and donations and donations as a share of income <a href="eas_donations.html#nonlin">in the next</a> section. For these models we express income in natural logs, so the interpretation of the ‘raw coefficients’ are approximately <em>income elasticities</em>; these are not on the same scale as the standardized coefficients below.<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref43" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn44"><p>However, as
noted above, we are cautious about these ‘year coefficients’ because of
potential changes in EA survey promotion and response that may not
reflect actual changes in the EA population.<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref44" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn45"><p>An alternate project might try to predict future total EA donations in total in subsequent years and decades. This could embody both a prediction problem for individuals and uncertainties at the aggregate level. This is even further from what we are doing here, but seems worthwhile for future work, combining the EA survey with other measures and assessments.<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref45" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn46"><p>The features include (nearly) all of those considered above, as well as ‘where first heard of EA’ responses. Giving What we Can’ pledge was not included here, because this seems to be too close to the outcome of interest (i.e., it seems to be a very strong collider). We do not include the decision-tree model in this plot: while such models are useful for interpretation, they are relatively unstable.<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref46" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn47"><p>Note that (as is common in machine learning modeling) all features have been normalized to be on the same scale; for continuous features such as age and income we take the natural log of each, and divide each by two standard deviations of the logged feature, following <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-gelmanScalingRegressionInputs2008" role="doc-biblioref">Gelman</a> (<a href="#ref-gelmanScalingRegressionInputs2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>.<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref47" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn48"><p>We might expect non-response to be associated with lower engagement, and perhaps lower donation rates. However, we are considering non-responses to particular questions <em>among</em> those who did report a donation amount. We could speculate about why non-response to the ‘where heard of EA’ question seems to be associated with donating more. E.g., perhaps people who donate more tend to come from a group that don’t feel as connected to any of the EA organizations/sources listed, but didn’t want to put “other/don’t remember” so skip the question. Or perhaps this nonresponse is picking up something about the value of time or income that was not fully captured in the income question (which not everyone answers) We hope to investigate this in future work. However, we don’t expect that this nonresponse will be useful in models aimed at predicting <em>future</em> donations, as the nonresponse here is basically occurring contemporaneously with donations. Note also that statisticians and economists caution against drawing inferences from machine-learning predictive models (<span class="citation"><a href="#ref-mullainathan2017" role="doc-biblioref">Mullainathan &amp; Spiess</a> (<a href="#ref-mullainathan2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017b</a>)</span>).<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref48" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>

bottom-coded as mentioned in previous sections.<a href="eas_donations.html#fnref49" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
