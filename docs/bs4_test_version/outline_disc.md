# Notes on this 'bookdown' relating to the EA Survey {#outline_disc}

Rmdnote thing below:

::: {.rmdnote}
 
This material is meant to supplement [EA Survey series posts on the EA forum](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/effective-altruism-survey), and may be linked in those posts.  It has been/is being put together by [David Reinstein](https://daaronr.github.io/markdown-cv/) of [Rethink Priorities](https://www.rethinkpriorities.org/our-team), with the collaboration and input from others at RP.

Now testing a lonely footnote, will it hover?^[please I hope it will hover]


And testing a 'foldable' ... these sometimes work, sometimes come out only as grey bars':


::: {.foldable} 
 
I might hope that it indeed does contain materials from multiple posts/chapters — imho that’s a key feature, not a bug. You can easily jump/link across these and also it gives people perspective.

## How shall we share/use this "current Bookdown"?


Currently (13 Mar 2021) this is shared on a private github repo but not 'hosted'. Only a few RP-staff are accessing and looking at this.

For the bookdown we might share publicly...

I might hope that it indeed does contain materials from multiple posts/chapters — imho that’s a key feature, not a bug. You can easily jump/link across these and also it gives people perspective.

However, I understand

- not wanting to overwhelm/confuse people (but this could probably be dealt with using good sign-posting)

- not wanting to link incomplete content if it could leave a bad impression (thus, if this is a concern, perhaps a version of the Bookdown with only public-ready content)
