# ea_data_public

Reports on EA Survey and more, to be made public and host html/bookdown from Rmd work. 

The actual code and data is in the [EA-data](https://github.com/rethinkpriorities/ea-data) private repo. A line in the `main_2020.R` file there copies the content to this repo in a parallel folder on one's hard drive, to be pushed here. 

No data will be shared here, for now at least.

Open any html files in the [docs folder](docs) (in a cloned repo, not in GH) to open the 'bookdown'

`Codebook` folder contains codebooks/descriptives of each year's EAS 

I (David Reinstein) am proposing hosting this on GH pages.
