It has been/is being put together by David Reinstein of Rethink Priorities, with the collaboration and input from others at RP. This version is for ‘public presentation.’ This bookdown is being built in the eas_public_presentation branch, to be web-hosted publicly (here on GH repo ‘ea-data’ or mirrored/simlinked somewhere else). In the ‘main’ github branch you will find the internal ‘working on the content’ version. It should contain the most up-to-date analysis but it is not meant for public consumption.

Getting surveys/polls right is difficult, as recent US electoral outcomes and polling exercises suggest. It hard to produce statistics that we can be confident are representative of a population-of-interest, particularly when: there are high non-response/non-participation rates, and these rates likely vary by groups and subgroups, we are considering a hidden/rare and fluctuating population, with ‘coverage’ limitations,* * We may not have have complete ‘coverage’ of relevant groups, e.g., some important parts of the EA population may not be reading the outlets that advertise the survey. there are few or no benchmarks to target and train on (such as actual voting records); nor ‘complete enumerations’ of the population of interest. 2.1 The challenge for the EA Survey (EAS) Considering representativeness of a survey with potentially substantial under-coverage, low participation rates, and a rare population In measuring the demographics, psychometrics, economic status, attitudes, behaviors, preferences, etc., of “the global population of those who identify with Effective Altruism and/or are influenced by EA ideas” we face the above trifecta. Selection issues are endemic to surveys. If the ‘propensity to complete a survey’ is related to any individual characteristic or response (and we don’t know the exact nature of this relationship), than the measured outcomes will be biased measures of the population outcomes. It is difficult or impossible to correct for such biases without a benchmark (such as an election result, a legal national census or a survey that offers an incentive so strong that it guarantees a near-100% response rate). We may not be able to ensure that we have ‘reasonable confidence that we have a reasonably representative sample.’ Without a benchmark, how would we know? If certain groups are not being reached at all (e.g., those not on the internet), there is very little we can do. However, suppose the survey merely under-represents groups with certain (observed) characteristics; e.g., suppose ‘mods’ are less likely to notice or respond to the survey as ‘rockers.’ To recover unbiased estimates, we would simply need to weight each group by the inverse probability of sampling, i.e., weight each rocker as half as important as a mod in constructing summary statistics. But for the EAS (and many other situations), we simply don’t know the extent to which each group is under-responding. The best we may be able to do is to consider the sensitivity of our results to the extent of under/oversampling along observable lines. (For 2020, this is the approach we take in considering demographics and key outcomes.) 2.1.1 Considering academic/formal literature I discuss this issue in a very general methodological sense here (a work-in-progress), in my broad set of methodological notes, and offer some (rough) discussion of relevant academic work. I present some key points and reference below. I did a fairly shallow dive into the methodological literature to put our problem in the context of survey sampling methodology, and to consider approaches to similar problems. ‘Probability sampling’ has been the standard approach in survey sampling since random-digit dialing was possible.* *This paragraph draws from the Wikipedia entry on ‘survey sampling’, as well as cited and connected articles. Probability sampling identifies a population of interest and a sample frame meant to capture this population. Rather than appealing to this entire population/frame, probability sampling randomly (or using stratification/clustering) samples a ‘probability share’ (e.g., 1/1000) from this frame. As only a smaller number of people are selected, you can spend more time and money/incentives, trying to make sure they respond, and track and adjust for rates of responses. Furthermore, probability sampling also allows ‘stratification,’ and oversampling of harder-to-reach groups. One can then potentially divide up (‘stratify’) that frame by observable groups, and randomly draw (sample) within each strata with a certain probability. If we have an informative estimate of the TRUE shares in each strata we can sample/re-weight so that the heterogeneous parameter of interest can be said to represent the average value for the true population of interest. In contrast, the EA Survey is a ‘non-probability sample’ (bakerSummaryReportAAPOR2013?). We have collected survey responses from self-selected ‘convenience’ samples (‘internet surveys’) across several years. Our current approach may be described as a combination of ‘convenience sampling’ (‘river sampling’ and ‘opt-in’) and ‘snowball sampling.’* I have heard claims that ‘internet surveys,’ if done right, with proper adjustments, can be as or more reliable than traditional polling. However, these adjustments depend on external measures and ‘gold standards,’ such as actual electoral outcomes, and large scale repeated census enumerations. In our context there seems to be little potential to reweight or ‘post-stratify’ to recover results that represent the EA population as a whole. Consider the Wikipedia entry on ‘convenience sampling’: Another example would be a gaming company that wants to know how one of their games is doing in the market one day after its release. Its analyst may choose to create an online survey on Facebook to rate that game. Bias The results of the convenience sampling cannot be generalized to the target population because of the potential bias of the sampling technique due to under-representation of subgroups in the sample in comparison to the population of interest. The bias of the sample cannot be measured. [emphasis added] Therefore, inferences based on the convenience sampling should be made only about the sample itself. (Wikipedia, on ‘Convenience sampling,’ cites Borenstein et al, 2017) This entry is deeply pessimistic… for our case. We might consider alternate or additional sampling approaches in future EA Surveys. Selected sampling will not, by itself, do anything to lessen the problem of differential non-participation. However, it is conceivable that we might take improve our representativeness through some combination of … Surveying the general (non-EA) population as part of larger representative surveys to get a sense of the overall composition of EAs (e.g., the gender ratio). However, differential non-response, to these larger surveys would again throw this in doubt. Standard corrections may not be easy: and relative non-response among EAs (e.g., male versus female EAs) may differ from the relative non-response to such surveys in other populations. Tracking, and attempting to adjust for particular rates of non-participation among groups with known compostions, and extending this, by inference, to groups with unknown composition.^* E.g., suppose we knew the true gender composition of EA Global participants was 80/20 male/female, and we see a 90/10 split from EAG participants in the EAS. We might then assign a double weight to female EAG participants in the EAS, and perhaps also assign a double weight to females in other groups where we expect a similar pattern. Additionally, taking probability samples from within known groups we expect to be ‘broadly representative of EA’ (or at least of particular interest) and offering much strong incentives to these individuals. If this lead to very-high participation rates among these probability samples, this would bring us closer to a gold-standard measure, at least for this group of interest. We might also consider “respondent-driven sampling” in combination with a careful measurement of the network structure of the EA population, and the sharing of the EAS in this network. As noted, the EAS considers a hidden/rare and fluctuating population, with ‘coverage’ limitations. (salganikSamplingEstimationHidden2004?) suggest using “respondent-driven sampling” (or ‘snowball sampling’ or ‘chain referral’) in such contexts, and making adjustments to recover representativeness (which will work only under particular condidtions). The process involves a small number of seeds who are the first people to participate in the study. These seeds then recruit others to participate in the study. This process of existing sample members recruiting future sample members continues until the desired sample size is reached. They note that This research is fairly well summarized by Berg (1988) when he writes, “as a rule, a snowball sample will be strongly biased toward inclusion of those who have many interrelationships with or are coupled to, a large number of individuals.” In the absence of knowledge of individual inclusion probabilities in different waves of the snowball sample, unbiased estimation is not possible. This motivates the authors’ approach, involving measuring the likelihood that an individual is reached as a function of their network, and then downweighting those individuals that are more likely to be sampled. They claim that through the process they propose, “it is possible to make unbiased estimates about hidden populations from these types of samples … asymptotically unbiased no matter how the seeds are selected.” While this approach is compelling, and may hold some potential for future EAS work, this is not feasible with the data we have now. Furthermore, it is not clear whether it would be an improvement. Relying on chain referral may increase the extent to which the EAS participants are skewed towards certain groups. Even if we take on the adjustments advocated in (salganikSamplingEstimationHidden2004?), this may add more ‘bias’ in net. Given the data we have, we thus focus on ‘sensitivity-testing,’ as discussed below.* * We also sketch and discuss some alternative analytical approaches, perhaps for future years, below). 2.2 Sensitivity-checks In our posts for the 2020 EA survey, we will focus (as we have, to some extent in the past) on ‘sensitivity testing.’ For key outcomes of interest, we will consider how our reported estimates vary … by ‘referrer’ (the link that brought the respondent to the EAS), varying the weights assigned to referrers with different characteristics (‘large pool’ vs ‘small pool,’ level of EA-alignment, etc.) and by time-to-respond and ‘agreement to respond to future surveys.’ (In our future ‘Engagement’ posts, we will also consider this by ‘level of self-reported engagement’).* *Those less-engaged are presumably less interested in filling out the survey, and thus ‘under-represented.’ While we might imagine that the views of less-engaged EA’s are less relevant to consider, this may not always be the case, and might not track 1-1 with their lower response rates. Why these groupings? Some referrers may be promoting the EAS more than others, and EA’s who identify with certain referrers may visit them more often than EA’s in other mileu. Reasonably, ‘being less eager to do something’ may lead to procrastination, or to requiring more reminders before you do it. If so, those who took the longest to respond to the survey (at least relative to the first time they first learned about the survey) may better reflect, within each group, those ‘less likely to take the survey’ (or respond to followup surveys). A similar argument applies to those who indicated they do not want to take future surveys. Arguably, these groups are under-represented. In future…** **In future we also aim to consider this by demographics and ‘clusters/vectors of demographics’ we particularly anticipate having differential response rates, in light of past survey research. Some demographics (particular considering career and family status) may face a greater time-cost, making them less likely to complete the survey, and leading to under-representation. mean_don &lt;- mean(eas_20$donation_2019_c, na.rm=TRUE) n_shared_link &lt;- sum(eas_20$referrer==&quot;Shared link&quot;) n_optin &lt;- sum(eas_20$referrer==&quot;Email; opt-in from prev.

EAS&quot;], na.rm=TRUE) sd_male_rate_optin &lt;- sqrt(male_rate_optin*(1-male_rate_optin)) 2.3 Modeling and bounding the biases In the sensitivity checks below we report values of key demographics and other important outcomes for each of the groupings mentioned above. Taking the extreme values (minima and maxima) of the outcomes across these groupings could be seen to embody fairly extreme and ad-hoc assumptions. For example we report a series of key outcomes for each referrer (and for some groupings of these). We also did this for groupings of level of self-reported engagement). Consider the largest and smallest value of each measure, across all referrers, of, e.g., ‘share identifying as Male.’ This leads to a low of 58.96% male (from the ‘shared link’) and a high of 82.67% male (the opt-in from last year’s survey). Constructing 80% standard statistical confidence intervals to each of these measures we have a lower-CI for ‘shared link’ of 54.66% and an upper-CI for ‘opt-in link’ of 85.89%. These bounds are clearly overly wide, i.e., overly conservative, at least in considering the impact of over/under-sampling from each referrer. Clearly, neither the ‘opt-in link’ (the most male group) nor the ‘shared link’ (the most female group) groups are so under-represented that they should constitute the virtual entirety of the EA population. We know that, e.g., 488 completed the survey from the 80K hours link, and 247 reported a level of engagement of 3 or more. This is not a ‘drop in the bucket’: estimates of the total number of “active EA’s” range from about 4700 to about 13000, or perhaps a few hundred thousand if we take the widest view (cf. ‘over 150,000 subscribers’ to the 80K hours newsletter).* * Also note, from the same linked post, some benchmarks: 19% of GWWC members are present in 2018 survey, but we might disagree about whether all GWWC members are EEA in terms of ‘being influenced by EA thought’ Informal polls of relatively heavily-engaged audiences record 30-50% response to the EAS (39% in CEA/80K/FHI Oxford offices, 40% for EA forum, 43% of Local group members, and 31-50% for specific local groups In future we might also use ‘total known numbers in particular groups’ as upper-benchmarks. 2.4 Other possible approaches (for future consideration) We are working to address these methodological issues more carefully, and work towards a theoretically grounded approach, both in considering the data we have, and our future survey design and implementation. Below, we present some ideas in this direction. Re-weighting approaches? We might consider ‘re-weighting (or ’post-stratification’) to match key demographics of some known group. For example, suppose we knew the gender and country composition of the members of the Effective Altruism Facebook Group. Under standard assumptions, reweighting the EAS results to match this might reduce the bias of our estimates – at least as a measure of the ‘average responses for those on EA Facebook.’ However: We do not expect that the ‘EA Facebook group’ is representative of the EA movement as a whole, and The re-weighting need not reduce the bias from differential response rates, even considering the EA FB group as the sampling frame of interest. For a particular outcome, considering particular subgroup weightings… this would only be guaranteed if the ‘nonresponders within each subgroup’ had the same distribution of this outcome as the overall population within each subgroup. Less extreme (but ad-hoc) sensitivity checking We might also consider sensitivity tests that are ‘less extreme’ than the bounds that might be implied by the tests below. E.g., we could consider…. Some ideas As a first-pass at these sensitivity checks, we might report bounds under ‘somewhat less extreme’ possibilities, under ad-hoc grouping assumptions Each individual referrer’s response rate (among true EA’s) is Normally distributed, with mean 40% and sd 20%. The ‘response rate draws’ are not following groupings of referrers may each have Or drop or downweight by 50% half of the list of referrers with all combinations, report the most extreme one? Or drop any single referrer one by one and find most extreme results Try to classify these groups (or a ‘vector’ of groups and downweight along these lines) By ‘time to respond’ (how to present/test this?) or some ‘likelihood of response?’ For those willing/unwilling to respond to share email for future surveys Another formal test? Consider sensitivity to downweighting by ‘Referrer’ (the link that brought the respondent to the EAS), varying the weights assigned to referrers with different characteristics (‘large pool’ vs ‘small pool,’ level of EA-alignment, etc.) Each referrer/grouping with over 100 responses Ad-hoc groupings: 80K, EA Forum, Email opt-in+shared link+Newsletter, Local Groups, Other 80K, EA Organisations/link (EA Forum, EA Newsletter, opt-in from prev. EAS), Social media/rationalist/blogs (Reddit, LW, SSC, FB, memes), Personal (Groups, Shared link) by level of self-reported engagement 0-2, 3, 4, 5 0-2, 3, 4-5 and by time-to-respond and ‘agreement to respond to future surveys.’ Time to respond relative to survey start date: 4 quantiles, RR of 80%, 60%, 40%, and 20% assumed Time to respond relative to others from same referrer … quantiles and RR as above Agreed to respond to future surveys (no/EAS only/EAS and followups) (20% vs 50% vs 80% RR assumed) Bayesian modeling of outcomes in light of (distributions) of response rates Perhaps the best approach would be a model that - makes our beliefs over the possible response rates for different groups explicit, - adjusts these in light of new information, - summarizes our uncertainty over possible outcome values in a ‘posterior distribution.’ A very rough sketch of such a ‘Bayesian model’ is folded below. Model components and assumptions: Probability distribution over the total number of (E)EAs (does this matter?) Suppose (all 3+ engaged EAs) for each referrer are in fact EA-affiliated. Critical component: A probability distribution over the ‘true response rate’ for each (referrer) group Benchmarks for this (as reported in earlier post) 19% of GWWC members present in 2018 survey (but are all GWWC members EEA?) 30-50% response rates of relatively heavily-engaged audiences* * From an informal poll, 39% in the CEA/80K/FHI Oxford office. Comparing response numbers in the EAS with the EA Groups survey implies 40% response rates for EA forum members, 43% Local group members, and 31-50% for a set of specific local groups, Total ‘members’ of specific referrers. At first pass, we might converge on a conservative guesstimate of: a normal distribution over EEA response rates for each referrer a 40 percent mean response rate (by referrer, and thus overall) A 90% CI for the response rate (of EEAs) for each referrer of 15 - 80 percent (this is totally ad-hoc) However, the hardest component to consider is the correlation between the response rates of sets of referrers . We might expect, e.g., the response rates of SSC and LW to be correlated. We can only partially deal with this by choosing larger groups and defining priors .grouping sets of of referrers. Thus we may need to define a prior over (e.g., if we assume multivatiate normality) the variance/covariance matrix. We do have some benchmark datasets that might help us with this … the SSC survey, EAGx demography … calculate weights to minimize error between our surveys and others … "],["demog.html", "3 Demographics: considering representativeness 3.1 Sensitivity checks", " 3 Demographics: considering representativeness #key binary/numeric demographics for summary comparisons key_demog &lt;- c(&quot;age_approx&quot;, &quot;d_male&quot;, &quot;d_student&quot;, &quot;race_white&quot;, &quot;d_live_usa&quot;, &quot;income_k_c&quot;, &quot;career_academia&quot;) key_demog_plus &lt;- c(key_demog, &quot;engagement_num&quot;) key_demog_cat &lt;- key_demog_plus key_outcomes &lt;- c(key_demog_plus, &quot;mn_priority_lt_rating&quot;, &quot;lt_top_priority&quot;, &quot;animal_top_priority&quot;, &quot;don_share_inc_19_imp&quot;) #DR: usually I don&#39;t do this but perhaps it makes the code more readable? attach(eas_20) See previous section: Methods: Weighting, representativeness, and sensitivity testing Recapping that discussion: In measuring the demographics of “the global population of those who identify with Effective Altruism” see ‘size of EA’ post here we face: high non-response/non-participation rates, which likely vary by groups and sub-groups, a hidden/rare and fluctuating population, no guarantee that we have complete ‘coverage’ of relevant groups, and we have few or no benchmarks (e.g., no complete enumeration of the population of interest). This makes it difficult to be highly confident in the representativeness of the demographics reported in this post (or even in the year-to-year changes, as response rates). We present this sensitivity testing below. 3.1 Sensitivity checks Following the previous discussion on the unique issues faced by the EA survey, we present a series of sensitivity checks. (Why these groupings? See discussion above.) Of course, we cannot report all measures for all sub-groups and weightings in a single post. We offer only a subset of this, and we aim to offer more in the future (perhaps in a dynamic/interactive presentation.) As noted above, these bounds are clearly overly wide, i.e., overly conservative, at least in considering the impact of over/under-sampling from each referrer and from each ‘willingness to respond’ group. Demographics by ‘referrer’ Respondents come to this survey from a range of ‘referrers’; we can track these links. The table and bar chart below breaks this down: cap &lt;- &quot;Referrer&quot; ( refer_tab &lt;- eas_20 %&gt;% tabyl(referrer_cat) %&gt;% arrange(-n) %&gt;% kable(caption=cap) %&gt;% kable_styling(latex_options = &quot;scale_down&quot;) ) Table 3.1: Referrer referrer_cat n percent 80K hours 488 0.23 EA Forum 427 0.20 Groups (local) 334 0.15 Email; opt-in from prev.

SSC&quot;))+ guides(fill=guide_legend(title=NULL)) + theme(legend.position = &quot;bottom&quot;) ) Note on statistics (unfold): I include standard deviation for all nonbinary variables the SD for binary variables doesn’t provide any additional information so I never put this in. (The SD for any binary variable is simply a function of the shares in each category), I do not show the standard error or confidence intervals in these tables because I do not want to suggest “testing for differences in outcome” by these splits. The point here isn’t to show ’look there are no significant differences”; of course there are. The point is “let’s consider what the range might be for the true mean or median of these outcomes,” if we allow that we may be over or under-representing groups along these observable lines. As part of this exercise, I could have also reported confidence intervals for the largest and smallest value of each measure across all subgroups, but this would not add much value in my opinion. We can be pretty sure these extreme values are already overly wide. A more involved take on this would do better to quantify our uncertainty: uncertainty due to standard ‘sampling error’ (any sample is only a draw from the population and may get averages wrong ‘by change’), as well as uncertainty over differential rates of non-response for groups with different ‘outcome variables.’ I sketch what that might look like very roughly here. Below, we report ‘engagement by referrer’ (with non-responses dropped, and 4 ‘other referrers’ dropped), i.e., ‘how engaged are those coming from each referrer.’ This depiction also shows the relative magnitudes of each grouping and subgrouping, allowing us to consider ‘where the action is.’ ( engage_by_ref &lt;- eas_20 %&gt;% filter(referrer_cat!=&quot;Other&quot;) %&gt;% filter(!is.na(engagement)) %&gt;% ggplot() + aes(x = forcats::fct_infreq(referrer_cat), fill = engagement) + geom_bar() + coord_flip() + scale_fill_brewer() + theme_minimal() + guides(fill=guide_legend(title=&quot;Self reported EA engagement level&quot;)) + labs(title=&quot;Engagement by Referrer (2020)&quot;, x = &quot;Referrer&quot;) ) #TODO: add an &#39;overall&#39; bar to this; put NA&#39;s as &#39;zeroes&#39;, i.e., the bar to the left. #TODO: try to preserve colors for each org (or for engagement?) across graphs -- see http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Colors_(ggplot2)/ &#39;use and reuse pallettes&#39; Next we consider referrer by engagement; i.e., the ‘referrer composition’ and size of each engagment group.

About half of those coming from all referrers rank a long-term cause at least as highly as any other non-LT cause (with the notable exception of GWWC). Other outcomes show more substantial variation. E.g., those opting-in from the previous EAS are substantially more male than those who were given a shared link. (Those referred from) the ‘rationalist groups’ (LW, SSC) are also a bit more male than the average, while those referred from ‘local groups’ are somewhat more female. Local groups also contain more students, a much lower share based in the US, and lower-earners, on average. Considering attitudes and behaviors, those referred from rationalist groups are the least engaged on average, while those from EA-Forum are the most-engaged. Similar patterns hold for the response to (absolute, not relative) prioritization of the aggregated long-term cause categories. LW/SSC also appear less likely to prioritize animal welfare, while those coming from Social Media (Dank EA Memes, EA FB, CEA FB, and Hangouts) tend to prioritize this more. Median donations as share of (imputed-where-missing) income is fairly constant around 2% across most referrers at around 2%, although it appears substantially higher for email-opt-ins and GWWC-referrals, and potentially somewhat lower for the rationalist groups. What does this tell us about the sensitivity of our results to under- or over-representation of particular referrers?. Some results are not particularly sensitive – for example,“EA’s tend to be young” across all groups of referrers. Demographics by willingness-to-respond to future surveys and by lateness of response We repeat the previous summary statistics by ‘willingness to respond in future,’ divided into those who did not wish to be contacted again for another EAS in future those willing to be contacted again for another EAS but not for additional relevant surveys those willing to be contacted again for another EAS as well as additional surveys While this breakdown may not be of direct interest, but it is relevant to our sensitivity-checking. As discussed, those least willing to respond to future studies may be more representative of under-sampled populations in the current survey. However, in future, we may perhaps avoid using this as a measure for adjusting the importance weights of each response, as it could be prone to manipulation. E.g., those who wished their survey responses to be ‘taken more seriously’ would then have an incentive to respond negatively to these questions. Note that we leave out the 10th and quantiles to save space here; these proved to be fairly similar across groups.

The chapter goes into more technical depth than the EA forum post, and presents some additional work and results. (However, some of the material from the forum post is not here, particular where it was created directly in Google Sheets; this is noted and linked below. See also our 2019 post on the same topic 4.1 Introduction We describe people’s self-reported levels of engaged in EA, what activities related to effective altruism they have completed and their group membership. We also describe differences in these modes of engagement across groups (gender, race, age, time in EA etc.) and present a series of models looking at factors associated with higher engagement. This hosted ‘bookdown’ content covers this in more detail, with folded code and some dynamic depictions. 4.1.1 Why do we care about ‘engagement?’ 2019 introduction: In recent years there has been significant interest in the levels of engagement of EAs and in particular, the most engaged members of the community. The focus and resources devoted to those considered “contributors” or “core”(1, 2) (add links) are likely very different to those considered part of the EA “network.” CEA has noted that the level of involvement with EA of typical applicants to EA Globals has risen so much that the typical person who didn’t get accepted to attend has changed from someone who was barely involved with EA to someone who is probably pretty knowledgeable about EA and has been involved for at least a few years. These points remain relevant. We present a descriptive picture of “who is more engaged” because this offers greater understanding of “what the EA movement looks like.” Those who are more engaged are likely to have a greater impact, and thus may be of greater interest for some considerationss. In addition to description, we are also interested in more ambitious predictive and even (at least suggestively) causal modeling of engagement for several reasons, also mentioned in previous posts. These serve three categories of goals Outreach, Planning, and Policy. Outreach: Knowing “who is likely to become engaged” may inform decisionmaking surrounding ‘how much resources to devote to recruiting and supporting EAs,’ and ‘at which age to recruit EAs’ (see further analysis of the latter question below. This motivates a predictive approach: trying to forecast (lifetime) engagement based on factors (e.g., age, career background, source of ‘first heard of EA’) that can be measured, and are fixed at a point in time before the engagement and involvement journey. (Unfold further discussion…) “EA lifetime value?”…. In other words, this can help movement and group leaders (and active EAs) make better decisions about how many resources to put into recruiting and retaining people from different areas and in different ways. One might make an analogy to “customer lifetime value” in marketing – companies will offer more costly promotions to those customers they think will be more valuable over the long term. This is not necessary the way we want to view this; it is just one perspective. Prediction and extrapolation; modeling concerns… If we know ‘which sorts of people were more likely to become engaged’ in the past, this may predict ‘which sorts… that we might recruit now, are likely to become engaged in the future.’ Of course, we should be careful about making these extrapolations, as the nature of background processes may change over time, as well as the links between an observed and observed factors. For example, ‘jazzy people’ in the years 2014-2016 may have tended to also have being a highly prosocially motivated, because the jazz movement was volunteer-based during this period. Thus, being jazzy in 2015 may have been highly predictive of EA engagement in 2020. But if the jazz movement started to pay people to join in 2020, then being jazzy in 2020 may poorly predict EA engagement in 2025. Differential attrition issue… Another factor that limits this: If we use only the 2020 survey, these estimates may be driven by differential attrition from EA, and from filling out the survey, as noted elsewhere. Suppose we find that people who are inherently jazzy (for simplicity, suppose this is an immutable characteristic), who we see in the 2020 survey, tend to be much more highly engaged. This could be because being jazzy is closely linked to engagement, or to another unobserved factor that predicts engagement. In such a case, we may expect this to be a good predictor of future engagement, and this would argue for us trying to heavily recruit jazzy people. However, another possibility is that jazzy people tend to only continue in the movement and fill out the surveys when they are heavily engaged, while non-jazzy people fill out the surveys equally regardless of their engagement level. We can only disentangle this by looking at earlier data and considering the differential rates of attrition. We have some evidence for differential rates of attrition, e.g., by ‘introducer’ – see Attrition from EA/EA survey by introducer in the “How EAs get Involved in EA” post. We are still considering how how to feasibly deal with this as we have fairly low rates of reseponses where people share their emails and thus limited connectivity across years. E.g., on average, an individual in any EA survey can be tracked over only 1.3 surveys. From fold: E.g., on average, an individual in any EA survey can be tracked over only 1.3 surveys 1.33 surveys) Taking into account both engagement and attrition, over a medium run, this will also inform decisions surrounding “whether and how much to encourage growth,” and how much to “focus on helping those already in the movement take further actions.” A key measure informing this decision is the “conversion rate” between new recruits to EA (who tend to be less engaged. and later heavily engaged EAs. Caveat: Diversity and other concerns… ‘Likelihood of becoming engaged’ may not be the only, or even the principle concern; recruiting diverse EAs from a variety of contexts is likely to be a goal in itself, and may also unlock new networks, opportunities, and approaches. Planning and anticipating movement growth: How is EA (and engagement) likely to grow over time, and in what ways? (Unfold further discussion…) We may want to know how large the movement is likely to grow over time, and what level of engagement we can predict in the future. This could inform choices we make about infrastructure as well as which approaches to focus on. For example (hypothetically), if it is unlikely that we will ever become a large and engaged movement, this may make direct political action less feasible and less worth planning, and we might be less concerned about the dilution of core ideas. Knowing what the composition of the movement is likely to look like in the future (e.g., age, demographics and geography) may also help identify more fruitful possibilities. The EA Survey may help us learn the ways the different participants tend to become more or less engaged over time, as well as whether they leave the movement entirely. This may allow better forecasting and planning. Policy/what works: Knowing “what might lead to people becoming more engaged” will help us choose which approaches to take in bringing people into the movement, encouraging their participation, and promoting different activities and messages. However, this causal inference is a harder target. Policy/what works: Knowing “what might lead to people becoming more engaged” will help us choose ‘policies,’ i.e., understand which approaches to take in bringing people into the movement, encouraging their participation, and promoting different activities and messages. However, this causal inference is a harder target (discussed in fold). To the extent that we do observe the ‘policies’ an individual EA faced (or things related to these, like the self-reported influences). These will tend to be related to other observable and unobservable characteristics (such as country, age, year-joined, individual’s educational choices), which in turn may have direct and indirect effects and relate to other important on observable determinants of engagement. As we do not have clear policy experiments or ‘natural experiments’ (see the literature on causal inference), we can, at best, look for patterns that suggest causal links. Because of this limitation, we will do this only sparingly in the current post/chapter. 4.2 Measures of Engagement 4.2.1 Engagement measures and validation As stated in 2019: It is important to state at the outset that being involved in the community by posting on the Forum, attending lots of events, or working at EA related organizations is not necessarily the same as dedication to EA or having the most impact. Here we examine how engaged in different activities are the 2,513 EAs who responded to the 2019 EA Survey. Naturally, what measure we should use to determine the most engaged EAs in the survey is controversial. Any proxy we select will also necessarily be imperfect as there will almost certainly be exceptions to the rule. In this post we examine potential proxies, which may each capture distinct modes of EA involvement; group membership, activities, and self-reported engagement. For the current post (for the 2020 survey) we focus on self-reported engagement. We give a simple table of self-reported engagement below: eas_20 %&gt;% tabyl(engagement) %&gt;% adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 2) %&gt;% .kable() %&gt;% .kable_styling() engagement n percent valid_percent No engagement 45 2.08% 2.36% Mild engagement 359 16.59% 18.85% Moderate engagement 569 26.29% 29.87% Considerable engagement 561 25.92% 29.45% High engagement 371 17.14% 19.48% NA 259 11.97% #eas_20 %&gt;% tabyl(engagement_num, referrer_cat) In a separate document linked HERE we present our work assessing whether the self-report engagement is meaningfully related to the behavior that are intuitively associated with engagement. The analysis strongly supports this association. 4.3 Descriptives of engagement (see forum post [LINK]) The content in this section was mainly created in created in Google Sheets. Thus we link the forum post here, rather than presenting it again. eas_20_m &lt;- eas_20 %&gt;% select( engagement, starts_with(&quot;action&quot;)) %&gt;% melt(id.vars=&quot;engagement&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(counter=1) %&gt;% group_by(engagement, variable) %&gt;% summarise(share = mean(value, na.rm=TRUE)) eas_20_m %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = engagement, y = share, fill = variable)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;) + coord_flip() 4.4 Descriptives: Engagement by Demographics, Socio-Economic factors, Attitudes/Behaviors, and Paths (and vice-versa) 4.4.1 Self-reported engagement: key comparisons We consider differences in key characteristics by level of engagement.

The least-engaged seem somewhat older, more female, less likely to be students, and less USA-based. The less-engaged also appear to be less long-termist. The most-engaged seem to donate a larger share of their income. Other patterns are less clear: median income seems to decline in engagement somewhat, while mean income is fairly constant. 4.4.2 Summary charts Descriptive measures also help us locate ‘where the engaged people are,’ and help us compare which groupings are more engaged. Below, we present ‘relative frequency stacked bar charts’ showing the ‘raw’ (uncontrolled) relationships between key characteristics and the levels of self-reported engagement. All bars are grouped from ‘highest to lowest share with 4-5 engagement,’ except for age, which is grouped by youngest to oldest. The bars depict 95% confidence intervals for the ‘shares of each subgroup with 4-5 engagement,’ as well as the narrower 1-standard-error bars. mutate_eng &lt;- function(df) { {df} %&gt;% filter(!is.na(engagement)) %&gt;% mutate(engagement= fct_recode(engagement, &quot;(1) None&quot; = &quot;(1) No engagement&quot;, &quot;(2) Mild&quot; = &quot;(2) Mild engagement&quot; , &quot;(3) Moderate&quot; = &quot;(3) Moderate engagement&quot;, &quot;(4) Considerable&quot; = &quot;(4) Considerable engagement&quot;, &quot;(5) High&quot; = &quot;(5) High engagement&quot;, )) } engage_stack_layers &lt;- list( geom_bar(aes(fill=engagement), position=&quot;fill&quot;), theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(), axis.text.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_blank() ), stat_summary(aes(y = engage_high_n), fun.data = mean_cl_normal, na.rm = TRUE, geom = &quot;errorbar&quot;, colour = &quot;pink&quot;, width = 0.2), stat_summary(aes(y = engage_high_n), fun.data = mean_cl_normal, na.rm = TRUE, geom = &quot;errorbar&quot;, colour = &quot;purple&quot;, width = 0.2, fun.args = list(mult = 1)), coord_flip() ) engage_by_age &lt;- eas_20 %&gt;% mutate_eng %&gt;% ggplot() + aes(x = fct_rev(age_approx_ranges) ) + engage_stack_layers + labs(title = &quot;Engagement x &#39;Age&#39;&quot;, x=&quot;Age&quot;, y=&quot;share&quot;, caption = &quot;95% CI bars for &#39;share 4-5 engaged&#39; in pink, 1 SE in purple&quot;) engage_by_gender &lt;- eas_20 %&gt;% filter(!is.na(engagement)) %&gt;% ggplot() + aes(x = reorder(gender_cat, engage_high_n) ) + engage_stack_layers + labs(title = &quot;... x Gender&quot;, x=&quot;Gender&quot;, y=&quot;share&quot;) engage_by_student &lt;- eas_20 %&gt;% filter(!is.na(engagement)) %&gt;% ggplot() + aes(x = reorder(student_cat, engage_high_n) ) + engage_stack_layers + labs(title = &quot;... x Student&quot;, x=&quot;Student&quot;, y=&quot;share&quot;) engage_by_race &lt;- eas_20 %&gt;% filter(!is.na(engagement)) %&gt;% ggplot() + aes(x = reorder(race_cat, engage_high_n) ) + engage_stack_layers + labs(title = &quot;... x Ethnicity&quot;, x=&quot;Ethnicity&quot;, y=&quot;share&quot;) engage_by_where_live_cat &lt;- eas_20 %&gt;% filter(!is.na(engagement)) %&gt;% ggplot() + aes(x = reorder(where_live_cat, engage_high_n) ) + engage_stack_layers + labs(title = &quot;... x Location&quot;, x=&quot;Where live&quot;, y=&quot;share&quot;) engage_by_city_cat &lt;- eas_20 %&gt;% filter(!is.na(engagement)) %&gt;% ggplot() + aes(x = reorder(city_cat, engage_high_n) ) + engage_stack_layers + labs(title = &quot;... x (Named) big city&quot;, x=&quot;Big&quot;, y=&quot;share&quot;) ( engage_by_cat_stack &lt;- ggarrange(engage_by_age, engage_by_gender, engage_by_student, engage_by_race, engage_by_where_live_cat, engage_by_city_cat, ncol = 2, nrow = 3, heights = c(1, 1), align = &quot;v&quot;, common.legend = TRUE, legend = &quot;bottom&quot;) ) Examining the proportion of respondents who self-identified as levels 1-3 vs 4-5 in terms of engagement, we observe that: Those &gt;34 years of age reported being less engaged Male respondents reported being more engaged Students reported being more engaged Those living in one of the 22 big cities named in the survey ^[These were cities known to have relatively high EA populations: Amsterdam, Auckland, Berlin, Boston / Cambridge (USA), Cambridge (UK) , Canberra, Chicago, London Los Angeles Melbourne, New York City, Oslo, Oxford, Philadelphia, Seattle, SF Bay Area, Stockholm, Sydney, Toronto, Vienna, Washington DC, Zürich] reported being more engaged In terms of country of residence groupings, UK + Ireland were the most engaged, and Canada + Australia + New Zealand the least engaged. 4.4.3 When people get involved in EA/ Time in EA / Age / Age When First Involved in EA This subsection, given in the Forum post, is mainly subsumed by the Engagement: age, tenure, period and cohort effects subsection below. 4.4.4 Gender and self-reported engagement, … and group membership - see forum post [LINK] 4.4.5 Race and and group membership; Race and activities - see forum post 4.4.6 Where people first heard of EA We analyzed differences in engagement between respondents who reported first hearing about EA from different sources in this earlier post and section.

However. we recognize that ‘being in the sample’ (considering attrition) may be a sort of confounder in itself. 4.5.2 Predictive and causal modeling As noted in the introduction [LINK], predictive and/or causal models inform Outreach, Planning, and Policy. We seek to build models that predict… Accurately: predicting outside the data the model was trained on (see the problem of “Overfitting”), and predicting throughout the range of the years of data, including the most recent data (Allowing for trends and trend-differences across years may make the model better at predicting well in the future.) …Based on variables we can and do observe at the time we make relevant policy choices. Thus: considering the limits of the EAS scope, and without using ‘ex-post’ and ‘outcome’ variables such as ‘participation in EA Forum’ (aka ‘leaks’ and ‘colliders’). …For EA individuals, not just for the subset of individuals who remain in EA/in the EA survey. Thus: We need to take attrition (from EA and from the survey) seriously, and potentially make it part of our model. 4.5.2.1 Ideal (future) modeling approach Ideally we would, and will… (unfold) I. Create a measure \\(G\\) (or set of measures) of ‘engagement’ (and or value-added) that captures the outcomes we think we are looking for. For the present, we will use “self-reported engagment (or dichotomising this into 1-3 vs 4-5).” As noted above, this measure seems to be ‘validated’ by the cluster analysis. Goals and relationships (theoretical structural model) In a perfect world, we would like to estimate a function for the (real or counterfactual) ‘level of engagement’ of person \\(i\\) in year \\(t\\), with permanent characteristics \\(X_i\\) and time-varying characteristics \\(X_{it}\\) (these are vectors), who became involved in EA in year \\(t_0\\), who was ‘exposed to a vector \\(S_t\\) of EA stimuli in each year since joining,’ summarized as \\(S \\equiv S_t \\forall t \\geq t_0\\). We can write this ‘true structural model’ as \\[G_{it} = f(t, X_i, X_{it}, S, t_0, t) + \\epsilon_{it}\\] where \\(\\epsilon_{it}\\) is an irreducible true random term. In principle, knowing the above ‘true model’…. … would allow us to address a range of causal questions about possible ‘interventions,’ e.g., how engaged would the average German Female who joins EA in 2021 be in 2025 if they were (A) exposed to a heavy diet of LessWrong and three 80K podcasts per month … versus (B) if they were not exposed to Less Wrong but (induced?) to taking the GWWC pledge and becoming vegan. Thus “what is the (causal) effect of (B) relative to (A)?” or similar ‘retrospective’ questions: … who joined EA in 2014 have been in 2020 if they had been exposed to some set of stimuli (C) versus (D)? (Or if they had joined in 2015 instead, etc.) More reasonably, we will never be able to observe all of the important characteristics of the individual, nor her exposures, never know the ‘true functional form’ of the model, nor be able to perfectly distinguish causal relationships from chance. (But we will do our best!) We aim for a more ‘predictive model’ first, while considering issues of causality. For example, considering the previous questions, we may aim to predict… What will be the average level of engagement for a typical individual whom we see, in year 0, in observable group \\(A\\), after \\(\\tau=5\\) years of being in EA’? How does the same measure differ from that of an individual whom we see in group \\(B\\)? I.e., \\[E\\big(G_{t_0+5}|A\\big) - E\\big(G_{t_0+5}|B\\big)\\] Consider “group,” to embody any number of characteristics we observe in the EAS, such as ‘place first heard of EA,’ or ‘country of origin.’ Here we are not asking the causal ‘counterfactual’ question ‘for the same individual how would this differ depending on whether they were in (or had the characteristics of) group A versus B, all else equal.’ All else is not equal: we realize that for any groupings A and B, people in these groups will have very different observable and unobservable characteristics (\\(X_i, X_{it}\\)) from one another, and also will be exposed to a different set of stimuli \\(S\\).* * They may also have joined EA in different calendar years (\\(t_0\\)), but we will explicitly try to keep this constant in our work. Instead, we will focus on making decent predictions to guide our policy choices. One might we mainly care most about making these predictions for people entering in future years, so as to better direct our resources (see above discussion of the ‘three goals’). Knowing that ‘EAs who joined through GWWC in 2014 are more active (in 2021) than those who joined through LW in 2017’ only informs our choices to the extent that these differences are stable, and likely to persist into future years. Choices of variables/features Prediction and outreach strategies: There are a range of categories on which we might want to make policy-relevant predictions about engagement. We may care specifically about the extent to which other things (demographics, initial alignment, etc) predict later engagement. In assessing the impact of a factor such as ‘introducer,’ a causal model might reasonably ‘control’ for other observable features, such as age and gender.* * However, causal interpretation will still require strong assumptions, and ‘controls’ can sometimes introduce additional bias to causal estimates. On the other hand, a predictive model may not want to ‘control’ in the same way. Suppose we were specifically considering the potential of each (e.g., ‘first-heard’) ‘channel’ in recruiting EEAs. Here, e.g., we may want to know whether LessWrong can be expected to outperform 80K allowing that part of this difference may be driven by age or gender differences. Here we might not want to “difference out” the component of the LW effect that comes from these.** ** However, we might bring this decomposition back in a mixed-modeling context. We focus on a few of these below Predictors (and/or causal factors) of interest for outreach questions ‘Place first heard of EA’ Demographics, geography, other identifiable characteristics For forecasting growth (and as ‘controls’ in interpreting the predictive features) We have not (yet) built a full ‘growth model.’ However, the features below may be informative and suggestive. Year entered EA (‘Cohort’): Particularly important in considering the aggregated retrospective data Time in EA (Tenure; hard to distinguish from cohort) Period (‘when’ we are seeing the level of engagement) However, it is difficult to separate period, cohort and tenure/age effects in general as well as in our specific case. In general, \\(Period = Cohort + Tenure\\); we cannot identify the ‘effect’ of all three of these independently, without any further restrictions. For 2020 retrospective data, \\(Period=2020\\) and \\(Cohort = 2020 - Tenure\\). Unless we are willing to make further assumptions (e.g., a linear impact of Tenure), we will necessarily pick up cohort and tenure effects together.* ::: {.marginnote} * I discuss ‘Traditional APC and APCC models’ further in my notes here … see “Age-period-cohort effects”… which I hope to expand. ::: More broadly, the growth of ‘engaged EA’ will depend on recruitment rates, attrition, on how people’s engagement changes with with tenure, and whether there are cohort (and secular period) trends towards less/more engagement.

These (arguably) should still not be interpreted as causal relationships. Below, we construct an ordered logit model, reporting the odds ratios. As noted in our ‘community information’ post, these can be loosely interpreted as the “relative probability of stating a 1 unit higher level of satisfaction,” relative to the base group. Interpreting these estimates… E.g., if the coefficient for ‘jazzy’ is 1.5, this means that, controlling for everything else in the model, comparing any two levels of engagement (2 versus 1, 5 versus 4, etc) jazzy people are approximately 50% more likely to be in the higher group. Note that the ordered logit model imposes a particular functional form: a variable must have proportional relative ‘effect’ on the probability of being in a higher versus a lower category, with this proportional ‘effect’ being the same between any comparison of adjacent categories. However, a strong justification can be made that this is ‘more realistic’ than a linear model, which interprets the 1-5 engagement self report as if it were a meaningful cardinal outcome. #satis_ologit_t0 &lt;- eas_20 %&gt;% polr(m_f(sat_outcome, t0_satis_vars), data = ., Hess=TRUE) %&gt;% ol_mdl &lt;- function(df, rhs) { polr( m_f(cat_out, {{rhs}}), data = df, Hess = TRUE ) %&gt;% broom::tidy(conf.int = TRUE, exponentiate = TRUE) %&gt;% filter(coef.type==&quot;coefficient&quot;) %&gt;% dplyr::arrange(-str_detect(term, &#39;d2sd&#39;)) %&gt;% mutate( term = str_replace_all(term, c(&quot;where_live_cat&quot;

However, it is confounded with differences that are driven by the changing nature of recruitment into the movement, as is not likely to be predictive (nor causal). Nonetheless, we mostly do not see strong differences from our baseline model, presented (again) in column (1). This does seeem to impact the odds-ratio for ‘Students.’ The naive model suggests students are less engaged, while the baseline model suggests they are engaged at about the same rate as others, given their (typically shorter) tenure in EA.* * The control for ‘years in EA’ also had a more substantial effect on the coefficients of the different ‘first-heard’ coefficients in column (3) of the previous table. Column (1a) repeats the base model, but dropping (rather than imputing) participants that did not respond to the age or ‘years involved’ questions (note the smaller number of observations). These results are very close to the base model.** ** We also ran a comparable model that dropped all cases with missing values for any of the variables in this mode. Again, the results (available by request) are largely similar. Column 1b adjusts the baseline model to use larger groupings. The results here suggest that those based in the USA are less engaged, controlling for other factors. (Other results are similar to previously-reported columns). These models are only able to “explain” a moderate share of the variation in engagement (but note we did not choose the models parameters to maximize this. The pseudo-r-sq for above models (Nagelkerke method) is 0.17 and 0.15 for the “(1) Baseline” and “(2) Baseline - no imputation,” respectively. The comparable statistic for most of the other models is close to that of model (1). Pseudo-r-sq for above models (Nagelkerke method): ol_engage_imp_m_nag_pr2 ## Nagelkerke ## 0.23 ol_engage_noimp_m_nag_pr2 ## Nagelkerke ## 0.21 For the “(1) Baseline” and “(2) Baseline - no imputation,” respectively. The comparable statistic for most of the other models is close to that of model (1). Further controls for age/tenure We present a similar model to the ‘baseline model’ (not shown in above table) with a robust set of controls for age and tenure – in addition to the linear controls for age and tenure we include controls for five age-range groups and four time-in-ea-range groups. The graph below depicts the other coefficients in a model with these controls, lined up next to the previous graph.* The idea is ‘flexibly control for X1, when we care about estimating the impact of X2.’ We don’t know the relationship between X1 and Y, but I believe I need to ‘control for it.’ The better I can control for it the more accurate my measurement of the impact of X2, call the latter a B2 coefficient. The standard approaches include (i) ‘matching in neighborhoods of X1’ (ii) estimate a flexible functional form for x1 like a polynomial and (iii) Control for ranges of X1 as well as a linear control to mop up the rest. One reason to do iii and not ii is that ii can easily go wrong and become sensitive to a few outliers in a way that may mess things up.

It is important to note that these are in multivariable models. Thus, while the odds-ratio shifter for ‘Where live: Other’ is among the most positive, this does not imply that the most-engaged EA’s are necessarily in these other countries.** ** This is probably not driven by our use of an ordered logit model; the linear model of the standardized 1-5 engagement measure finds a similar positive shift. 4.5.3.1 Selection and differential attrition: focus on recent recruits We previously discussed how differential selection and attrition could drive the above models to suggest unwarranted predictions. We thus present a model isolating just those who say they became involved in 2019, 2018, or 2017. This includes most of ‘those with have been in EA less than the average duration.’ However it excludes those who joined in the survey year itself (2020), as those in their first year may be less able to gage their own engagment. We might suppose that the differential selection is less substantial over this shorter range of tenure. We might also imagine that patterns among ‘newer recruits’ are likely to be more reflective of future patterns. If so, the results below might be more predictive of engagement levels, and more useful for our ‘policy choices.’ newby_eas_20_s_imp &lt;- eas_20_s_imp %&gt;% filter(years_involved_d2sd &lt; -0.001 &amp; years_involved_d2sd &gt; -0.5) %&gt;% #this captures people involved in 2018-2020 mutate(year_involved = case_when( #recovering year_involved from trnasformed variable years_involved_d2sd &lt; -.3 ~ &quot;2019&quot;, years_involved_d2sd &gt; -.3 &amp; years_involved_d2sd &lt; -.1 ~ &quot;2018&quot;, years_involved_d2sd &gt; -.1 ~ &quot;2017&quot; ), USA = where_live_cat==&quot;USA&quot; ) older_eas_20_s_imp &lt;- eas_20_s_imp %&gt;% filter(year_involved_groups == &quot;2014 or before&quot; | year_involved_groups == &quot;2015-16&quot;) %&gt;% #this captures people involved in 2018-2020 mutate( USA = where_live_cat==&quot;USA&quot; ) newby_ol_engage_imp &lt;- newby_eas_20_s_imp %&gt;% ol_mdl(c(key_predictors, &quot;years_involved_d2sd&quot;)) older_ol_engage_imp &lt;- older_eas_20_s_imp %&gt;% ol_mdl(c(key_predictors, &quot;years_involved_d2sd&quot;)) newby_ol_engage_possible_endog &lt;- newby_eas_20_s_imp %&gt;% ol_mdl(c(key_predictors, &quot;year_involved&quot;, possible_endog)) newby_ol_engage_possible_endog_USA &lt;- newby_eas_20_s_imp %&gt;% ol_mdl(c(&quot;age_approx_d2sd&quot;,&quot;gender_cat&quot;,&quot;student_cat&quot;, &quot;race_cat&quot;,&quot;USA&quot;, &quot;city_cat&quot;, &quot;year_involved&quot;, possible_endog)) fh_imp_n &lt;- newby_eas_20_s_imp %&gt;% smn(&quot;first_hear&quot;) newby_ol_engage_fh_imp &lt;- newby_eas_20_s_imp %&gt;% ol_mdl(c(key_predictors, &quot;year_involved&quot;, fh_imp_n)) These models involve only 807 responses.

We see less engagement for living in Canada, Australia, or New Zealand. (The base group, the USA is marginally less engaged; see other models). Comparing a simpler model for those involved from 2017-2019 to a separate model for those involved in earlier years (both of these models use the linear time-in-EA control and the smaller, ex-ante set of variables): ( newby_ol_engage_imp_tree &lt;- newby_ol_engage_imp %&gt;% filter(!grepl(&quot;NA$|Age|involve|Involved&quot;,term)) %&gt;% ggcoefstats(statistic=t, sort=&quot;ascending&quot;, stats.labels = &quot;TRUE&quot;, title = &quot;Engagement of those involved in 2017-19: associated factors &quot;, subtitle = &quot;Ordered logit, 95% CI&#39;s; &#39;Ex-ante features&#39;; NA ratios &amp; age &amp; tenure controls hidden&quot;, vline=FALSE) + ggplot2::labs( x= NULL, y = &quot;Characteristics (normalized)&quot; ) + geom_vline(xintercept=1, colour=&quot;grey&quot;) + geom_text(aes(x=1, label=&quot;Odds=1&quot;, y=5), colour=&quot;brown&quot;, angle=90, vjust = -.9) + scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0, 4.75)) ) %&gt;% ggplotly ( older_ol_engage_imp_tree &lt;- older_ol_engage_imp %&gt;% filter(!grepl(&quot;NA$|Age|involve|Involved&quot;,term)) %&gt;% ggcoefstats(statistic=t, sort=&quot;ascending&quot;, stats.labels = &quot;TRUE&quot;, title = &quot;Engagement of those involved before 2017...&quot;, vline=FALSE) + ggplot2::labs( x= NULL, y = &quot;Characteristics (normalized)&quot; ) + geom_vline(xintercept=1, colour=&quot;grey&quot;) + geom_text(aes(x=1, label=&quot;Odds=1&quot;, y=5), colour=&quot;brown&quot;, angle=90, vjust = -.9) + scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0, 4.75)) ) %&gt;% ggplotly() ( engage_newby_v_older &lt;- ggarrange(newby_ol_engage_imp_tree, older_ol_engage_imp_tree, ncol = 1, nrow = 2, heights = c(1, 1), align = &quot;v&quot;, common.legend = TRUE, legend = &quot;bottom&quot;) ) Although the confidence intervals are rather wide, especially for the longer tenure group, it looks fairly constant. The only major visual difference is that Can/Aus/NZ is ‘positive’ for those who joined in the earlier years (and persisted) and ‘negative’ for recent joiners. But again, this could be driven by differential selection. Linear models (of levels and binary) To consider the previous results’ sensitivity to functional form, we resent linear models considering: self-reported engagement (engagement_num =1-5) as if it were a meaningful cardinal outcome, and also the binary ‘highly engaged’ self-reported outcome of (‘4-5 engagement’ vs ‘1-3 engagement’) #satis_ologit_t0 \\&lt;- eas_20 %\\&gt;% polr(m_f(sat_outcome, t0_satis_vars), data = ., Hess=TRUE) %\\&gt;% #OK my &#39;coefficients as deviations&#39; is not working.

Where these are missing they are coded as zero, the mean of the transformed variable (except in the “no imputation” column, where these are left out of the regression, leading to a smaller sample size.)

See also “Tenure and ‘age first heard’ vs engagement” in demography chapter/post. Aspirationally: We would like to separate cohort, trend, and age effects here; we will have more possibility to do this if we combine data from earlier years. “Engagement by years since joining, controlling for year and age” “Engagement by year, controlling for years since joining and age”… 4.6.1 Engagement by tenure/age: ‘prediction for “outreach at what age?”’ A major concern might be: ‘What is the optimal age to reach out to EA’s?’ In a best-case we’d want to estimate the function (not ‘customer lifetime value’ but…) ‘effective lifetime value’ (\\(ELV\\)) as a function of ‘age first heard of EA’ (\\(afh\\)), and everything else (\\(X\\)): \\[ELV = f(AFH, X)\\] and look for the values of AFH that maximizes this, perhaps averaging over the ‘everything else’ stuff. Of course, we don’t know ELV, and it would take a great effort (as well as controversial assumptions) to construct this: More simply, we could plot: Engagement at age \\(A\\) as a function of age-first-heard (AFH): This would combine both Tenure effects, as those who started younger have been in longer and unfortunately, differentially attrited, adding a possible bias, and Receptiveness-at-age effects (e.g., earlier inculcation is stronger) Selection-at-age effects (e.g., those who we tend to recruit younger might be more engage-prone) Engagement \\(T\\) years after first-heard as a function of AFH, combining Receptiveness-at-age effects (e.g., earlier inculcation is stronger) standard life-cycle age effects selection-at-age effects Simple ‘engagement level by age’ roughly capturing the life-cycle age effects but combining a variety of effects, including, e.g., ‘younger people might be more active,’ and ‘young people tend to have been in EA for less time’ 4.6.2 Engagement by age and tenure Below, we plot the ‘engagement level by age’ for the 2020 survey data… #aet &lt;- eas_20 %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% dplyr::select(age_approx_ranges, engagement_num, tenure) #p_load(scatterplot3d) #scatterplot3d(eas_20$engagement, eas_20$age_approx, eas_20$tenure, highlight.3d=TRUE, col.axis=&quot;blue&quot;, col.grid=&quot;lightblue&quot;, main=&quot;scatterplot3d - 1&quot;, pch=20) #ggExtra to add densities ( engage_by_age &lt;- eas_20 %&gt;% ggplot() + aes(x = age_approx, y = engagement_num) + geom_point(size = 0.30, colour = &quot;#0c4c8a&quot;, position = position_jitter(seed = 42, width = 0.1, height = 0.2)) + geom_smooth(span = 0.71) + scatter_theme + xlim(10L, 75L) + labs(y = get_label(eas_20$engagement_num), x = get_label(eas_20$age_approx))+ labs(title = &quot;Engagement (2020) by age&quot;) ) %&gt;% ggplotly() Looking at the average level of engagement of EAs of different ages, we observe a non-linear trend, with engagement flat or slightly increasing until the mid-to-late 20s and then declining. However, this should be expected to be strongly confounded with time-in-EA (or ‘tenure’), as EAs who have been in longer might be expected to be both older and more engaged than those who have joined EA more recently. (And age, being tied to year-first-involved, may also reflect differences in the cohorts introduced to EA).) Noting this, we plot tenure against age below: ( tenure_by_age &lt;- eas_20 %&gt;% ggplot() + aes(x = age_approx, y = tenure) + geom_point(size = 0.30, colour = &quot;#0c4c8a&quot;, position = position_jitter(seed = 42, width = 0.1, height = 0.2)) + geom_smooth(span = 0.71) + scatter_theme + xlim(10L, 75L) + labs(y = get_label(eas_20$tenure), x = get_label(eas_20$age_approx)) + labs(title = &quot;Tenure by age (2020)&quot;) ) %&gt;% ggplotly() Indeed, tenure seems to increase steeply in age for ages below about 30. This could occur mechanically from an age-barrier to being introduced to EA; perhaps most people are not introduced to it until university. Engagement by Age, ‘faceted’ by tenure (time in EA): We also plot the relationship between age and average engagement for different groups of cohorts (0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-5 and 5-11 years in EA). Here we still see a pattern of average engagement sharply increasing and then declining with increasing age. However, for each successively earlier set of cohorts (i.e. people who have been in EA longer), the peak age for engagement is commensurately older. label_x &lt;- function(p) { b &lt;- ggplot_build(p) x &lt;- b$plot$data[[b$plot$labels$x]] p + scale_x_continuous( attributes(x)$label, breaks = attributes(x)$labels, labels = names(attributes(x)$labels) ) } ( engagement_by_age_facet_tenure &lt;- eas_20 %&gt;% ggplot() + aes(x = age_approx, y = engagement_num) + geom_point(size = 0.20, colour = &quot;#0c4c8a&quot;, position = position_jitter(seed = 42, width = 0.1, height = 0.2)) + geom_smooth(span = 0.71) + scatter_theme + facet_grid(vars(), vars(tenure_ranges)) + xlim(10L, 75L) + ylim(0, 5.5) + labs(title = &quot;Engagement by age&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Faceted by time in EA&quot;) + labs(y = get_label(eas_20$engagement_num), x = get_label(eas_20$age_approx)) ) %&gt;% ggplotly() Engagement appears to decrease in age for all tenure ranges. The peak of engagement is around 20-years-old. However, this apparent ‘peak’ at age 20 may be illusory. Further data and modeling are needed (see note). It might be that the age-20 thing is a ‘real peak’ (i.e., that people age 20 are more active than people age 18). But the CI’s are wide in the faceted data. To get a more precise estimate of ‘age 18’ vs ‘age 20’ (holding tenure constant) we need to look more carefully, within a model with, e.g., a linear tenure term Even within the tenure facets, there are variations in tenure, which may be driving the ‘bump at the beginning’ … those who are older still tend to have more tenure. (Also remember that this could be driven by a persistence/selection effect). Engagement by tenure: ( engagement_by_tenure_overall &lt;- eas_20 %&gt;% ggplot() + aes(x = tenure, y = engagement_num) + geom_point(size = 0.30, colour = &quot;#0c4c8a&quot;, position = position_jitter(seed = 42, width = 0.1, height = 0.2)) + geom_smooth(span = 0.75) + scatter_theme + labs(title = &quot;Engagement by time in EA&quot;) + labs(y = get_label(eas_20$tenure), x = get_label(eas_20$engagement_num)) ) %&gt;% ggplotly() Engagement by tenure, ‘faceted’ by age groupings: ( engagement_by_tenure_facet_age &lt;- eas_20 %&gt;% ggplot() + aes(x = tenure, y = engagement_num) + geom_point(size = 0.30, colour = &quot;#0c4c8a&quot;, position = position_jitter(seed = 42, width = 0.1, height = 0.2)) + geom_smooth(span = 0.75) + scatter_theme + facet_grid(vars(), vars(age_approx_ranges), scales = &quot;free&quot;) + labs(title = &quot;Engagement by time in EA&quot;, subtitle = &quot;Faceted by Age&quot;) + labs(y = get_label(eas_20$engagement_num), x = get_label(eas_20$tenure)) ) %&gt;% ggplotly Engagement appears to increase in tenure for all age range (the ‘dip’ for the 26-29 age range has very wide confidence intervals and appears driven by a few observations). The slope appears particular positive in the first few years. However, given that this is recall data (2020 retrospective only), we cannot rule out that this is driven by a selectivity effect (only those who are engaged choose to persist). We plot this again on a single graph: (engage_age_group_tenure &lt;- eas_20 %&gt;% ggplot() + aes(x = age_approx, y = engagement_num, colour = tenure_ranges, group = tenure_ranges) + geom_point(size = 0.20, colour = &quot;#0c4c8a&quot;, position = position_jitter(seed = 42, width = 0.1, height = 0.2)) + geom_smooth(span = 0.71, se=F) + scatter_theme + xlim(15L, 75L) + ylim(0, 5.5) + labs(title = &quot;Engagement by age, grouped by tenure:&quot;) ) %&gt;% ggplotly 4.6.3 Engagement by ‘Age-first-involved’ and tenure Below, we also depict each of the above graphs in terms of ‘age-first-involved’ (AFI) and tenure. Note again that, as we are only using 2020 recall data here, \\(tenure = 2020 - year\\_first\\_involved\\). Thus, this simply implies a re-labeling and a shifting, as seen below.

I suspect that, holding tenure constant… … life-cycle-age: “I’m now 20, so I can be active vs. I’m 35 and I have a mortgage and 4 kids” plays a greater effect than “receptivity at the age when I joined EA” (‘I got involved at 20 when I was impressionable’) Next, the ‘effect’ of tenure, faceted by age first involved (vs. age) engagement_by_tenure_facet_afi &lt;- eas_20 %&gt;% ggplot() + aes(x = tenure, y = engagement_num) + geom_point(size = 0.30, colour = &quot;#0c4c8a&quot;, position = position_jitter(seed = 42, width = 0.1, height = 0.2)) + geom_smooth(span = 0.75) + ggthemes::theme_solarized_2() + facet_grid(vars(), vars(age_first_inv_ranges), scales = &quot;free&quot;) + labs(title = &quot;Engagement by tenure, faceted by age-first-involved&quot;) ( engagement_by_tenure_facet_afi_vs_age &lt;- ggarrange(engagement_by_tenure_facet_afi, engagement_by_tenure_facet_age, ncol = 1, nrow = 2, heights = c(1, 1), align = &quot;v&quot;, common.legend = TRUE, legend = &quot;bottom&quot;) ) The above graphs differ only slightly, as the definition of the quantiles used for faceting are slightly different. Finally, the analogue to the grouped (single-graph) plots: engage_afi_group_tenure &lt;- eas_20 %&gt;% ggplot() + aes(x = age_first_inv, y = engagement_num, colour = tenure_ranges, group = tenure_ranges) + geom_point(size = 0.20, colour = &quot;#0c4c8a&quot;, position = position_jitter(seed = 42, width = 0.1, height = 0.2)) + geom_smooth(span = 0.71, se=F) + theme_minimal() + xlim(15L, 75L) + ylim(0, 5.5) + labs(title = &quot;Engagement by age-first-involved, grouped by tenure:&quot;) ( engage_afi_vs_age_group_tenure &lt;- ggarrange(engage_afi_group_tenure, engage_age_group_tenure, ncol = 2, nrow = 1, heights = c(1, 1), align = &quot;h&quot;, legend = &quot;bottom&quot;) ) The above graphs are nearly identical but for the slight shift in the x-axis, and the inclusion of the NA tenure-range category (we cannot infer age-first-involved where individual’s did not answer this question).* * There also seem to be some very small differences in the shape of the smoothed plots; this might result from a quirk in the smoothing algorithm, or some rounding issue, I am not sure. 4.6.4 See also: Attrition from EA/EA survey by introducer 4.7 Additional – CEA request: cities/areas by group engagement and retention, adapted: ( retain_engage_by_area &lt;- eas_20 %&gt;% mutate( city = as.character(city), country = as.character(country), cea_region_selection = case_when( str_detect(city, &quot;London|New York|SF Bay|DC&quot;) ~ city, str_detect(country, &quot;Netherlands|Germany&quot;) ~ country, TRUE ~ &quot;Other&quot;, ), group_made_more_engaged = as.numeric(engaged_local_groups==&quot;Made me a lot more likely to stay engaged&quot;|engaged_local_groups==&quot;Made me more likely to stay engaged&quot;) ) %&gt;% filter(!is.na(engaged_local_groups)) %&gt;% ggplot() + aes(x = reorder(cea_region_selection, group_made_more_engaged) ) + geom_bar(aes(fill=engaged_local_groups), position=&quot;fill&quot;) + stat_summary(aes(y = group_made_more_engaged), fun.data = mean_cl_normal, na.rm = TRUE, geom = &quot;errorbar&quot;, colour = &quot;white&quot;, width = 0.35) + stat_summary(aes(y = group_made_more_engaged), fun.data = mean_cl_normal, na.rm = TRUE, geom = &quot;errorbar&quot;, colour = &quot;brown&quot;, width = 0.35, fun.args = list(mult = 1)) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1)) + labs(title = &quot;&#39;Impact of groups on engagement&#39; by select areas&quot;, x=&quot;City/country&quot;, y=&quot;share&quot;, caption = &quot;95% CI bars for &#39;Made more/ a lot more likely&#39; in white, 1 SE in brown&quot;) + coord_flip(ylim = c(0, 1)) ) Above, for a select list requested by CEA. Note that this excludes some larger cities and countries. The above should be treated cautiously. There are several other things wrong with the inferences one might draw from this analysis. Differential selection (e.g., one city’s EA group is very insular and exclusive, so only those who are really in the clique join it and report high levels) Differential baseline characteristics of EA’s in different cities 4.8 Conclusions and Future work This post has presented a descriptive picture of the ways EAs engage, how they rate their own engagement, and how these relate to other attitudes and observable characteristics. This broadly aids our understanding of “what engagement in the EA movement looks like” and “who/what/where” EA’s engage. In addition to description, we are also interested in more ambitious predictive and even causal modeling of engagement for several reasons. As discussed in the supplement [LINK], we may care about (i) Outreach, (ii) Planning, and (iii) Policy. Key questions include Which types of people are more or less likely to become engaged in EA, and how does this inform EA organizations’ optimal outreach strategies, if at all? What approaches lead people to become more involved in EA? How large is the EA movement likely to grow over time, and what levels (and types) of engagement can predict this? This could inform our plans for building infrastructure, as well as our impact strategies and approaches. We suspect that more in-depth analysis of these issues is warranted, and we hope to pursue this going forward. For example:, We are working to bring together the EA survey data across years, allowing us to separate “time in EA” from “year joined EA,” and perform “Age-Period-Cohort” analysis. Considering “movement growth”: We hope to combine this with medium-term prediction models explicitly quantifying our uncertainty into probabilistic forecasts of key outcomes. We aim to build (ML) models to predict engagement outcomes from initially-observable characteristics. In particular, we could initial characteristics/responses from earlier EAS data to predict presence in later surveys, as one measure of engagement. (We can connect some participants across surveys through anonymized emails.) We expect causal inference, learning what approaches would “make people become more involved,” will be more difficult. Key explanatory variables are entangled, and were not ‘experimentally assigned’: the ways that people are introduced to EA, the groups they are associated with, their experiences, and the ways that EA groups and organizations interact with members, etc. Nonetheless, further analysis, using techniques from the fields of causal inference, statistics, and econometrics, may allow us to make some reasonable causal inferences "]]
